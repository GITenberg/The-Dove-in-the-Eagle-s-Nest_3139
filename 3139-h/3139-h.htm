<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> sending forth this little book,
I am inclined to add a few explanatory words as to the use I have
made of historical personages.&nbsp; The origin of the whole
story was probably Freytag&rsquo;s first series of pictures of
German Life: probably, I say, for its first commencement was a
dream, dreamt some weeks after reading that most interesting
collection of sketches.&nbsp; The return of the squire with the
tidings of the death of the two knights was vividly depicted in
sleep; and, though without local habitation or name, the scene
was most likely to have been a reflection from the wild scenes so
lately read of.</p>
<p>In fact, waking thoughts decided that such a catastrophe could
hardly have happened anywhere but in Germany, or in Scotland; and
the contrast between the cultivation in the free cities and the
savagery of the independent barons made the former the more
suitable region for the adventures.&nbsp; The time could only be
before the taming and bringing into order of the empire, when the
Imperial cities were in their greatest splendour, the last free
nobles in course of being reduced from their lawless liberty, and
the House of Austria beginning to acquire its preponderance over
the other princely families.</p>
<p>M. Freytag&rsquo;s books, and Hegewisch&rsquo;s History of
Maximilian, will, I think, be found fully to bear out the picture
I have tried to give of the state of things in the reign of the
Emperor Friedrich III., when, for want of any other law, <i>Faust
recht</i>, or fist right, ruled; <i>i.e.</i> an offended
nobleman, having once sent a <i>Fehde-brief</i> to his adversary,
was thenceforth at liberty to revenge himself by a private war,
in which, for the wrong inflicted, no justice was exacted.</p>
<p>Hegewisch remarks that the only benefit of this custom was,
that the honour of subscribing a feud-brief was so highly
esteemed that it induced the nobles to learn to write!&nbsp; The
League of St. George and the Swabian League were the means of
gradually putting down this authorized condition of deadly
feud.</p>
<p>This was in the days of Maximilian&rsquo;s youth.&nbsp; He is
a prince who seems to have been almost as inferior in his foreign
to what he was in his domestic policy as was Queen
Elizabeth.&nbsp; He is chiefly familiar to us as failing to keep
up his authority in Flanders after the death of Mary of Burgundy,
as lingering to fulfil his engagement with Anne of Brittany till
he lost her and her duchy, as incurring ridicule by his
ill-managed schemes in Italy, and the vast projects that he was
always forming without either means or steadiness to carry them
out, by his perpetual impecuniosity and slippery dealing; and in
his old age he has become rather the laughing-stock of
historians.</p>
<p>But there is much that is melancholy in the sight of a man
endowed with genius, unbalanced by the force of character that
secures success, and with an ardent nature whose intention
overleapt obstacles that in practice he found insuperable.&nbsp;
At home Maximilian raised the Imperial power from a mere cipher
to considerable weight.&nbsp; We judge him as if he had been born
in the purple and succeeded to a defined power like his
descendants.&nbsp; We forget that the head of the Holy Roman
Empire had been, ever since the extinction of the Swabian line, a
mere mark for ambitious princes to shoot at, with everything
expected from him, and no means to do anything.&nbsp;
Maximilian&rsquo;s own father was an avaricious, undignified old
man, not until near his death Archduke of even all Austria, and
with anarchy prevailing everywhere under his nominal rule.&nbsp;
It was in the time of Maximilian that the Empire became as
compact and united a body as could be hoped of anything so
unwieldy, that law was at least acknowledged, <i>Faust recht</i>
for ever abolished, and the Emperor became once more a real
power.</p>
<p>The man under whom all this was effected could have been no
fool; yet, as he said himself, he reigned over a nation of kings,
who each chose to rule for himself; and the uncertainty of
supplies of men or money to be gained from them made him so often
fail necessarily in his engagements, that he acquired a
shiftiness and callousness to breaches of promise, which became
the worst flaw in his character.&nbsp; But of the fascination of
his manner there can be no doubt.&nbsp; Even Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
English ambassadors, when forced to own how little they could
depend on him, and how dangerous it was to let subsidies pass
through his fingers, still show themselves under a sort of
enchantment of devotion to his person, and this in his old age,
and when his conduct was most inexcusable and provoking.</p>
<p>His variety of powers was wonderful.&nbsp; He was learned in
many languages&mdash;in all those of his empire or hereditary
states, and in many besides; and he had an ardent love of books,
both classical and modern.&nbsp; He delighted in music, painting,
architecture, and many arts of a more mechanical description;
wrote treatises on all these, and on other subjects, especially
gardening and gunnery.&nbsp; He was the inventor of an improved
lock to the arquebus, and first divined how to adapt the
disposition of his troops to the use of the newly-discovered
fire-arms.&nbsp; And in all these things his versatile head and
ready hand were personally employed, not by deputy; while coupled
with so much artistic taste was a violent passion for hunting,
which carried him through many hairbreadth &rsquo;scapes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was plain,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;that God
Almighty ruled the world, or how could things go on with a rogue
like Alexander VI. at the head of the Church, and a mere huntsman
like himself at the head of the Empire.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
<i>bon-mots</i> are numerous, all thoroughly characteristic, and
showing that brilliancy in conversation must have been one of his
greatest charms.&nbsp; It seems as if only self-control and
resolution were wanting to have made him a Charles, or an Alfred,
the Great.</p>
<p>The romance of his marriage with the heiress of Burgundy is
one of the best known parts of his life.&nbsp; He was scarcely
two-and-twenty when he lost her, who perhaps would have given him
the stability he wanted; but his tender hove for her endured
through life.&nbsp; It is not improbable that it was this still
abiding attachment that made him slack in overcoming difficulties
in the way of other contracts, and that he may have hoped that
his engagement to Bianca Sforza would come to nothing, like so
many others.</p>
<p>The most curious record of him is, however, in two books, the
materials for which he furnished, and whose composition and
illustration he superintended, <i>Der Weise King</i>, and
<i>Theurdank</i>, of both of which he is well known to be the
hero.&nbsp; The White, or the Wise King, it is uncertain which,
is a history of his education and exploits, in prose.&nbsp; Every
alternate page has its engraving, showing how the Young White
King obtains instruction in painting, architecture, language, and
all arts and sciences, the latter including magic&mdash;which he
learns of an old woman with a long-tailed demon sitting, like
Mother Hubbard&rsquo;s cat, on her shoulder&mdash;and
astrology.&nbsp; In the illustration of this study an
extraordinary figure of a cross within a circle appears in the
sky, which probably has some connection with his scheme of
nativity, for it also appears on the breast of Ehrenhold, his
constant companion in the metrical history of his career, under
the name of Theurdank.</p>
<p>The poetry of <i>Theurdank</i> was composed by
Maximilian&rsquo;s old writing-master, Melchior Pfinznig; but the
adventures were the Kaisar&rsquo;s own, communicated by himself,
and he superintended the wood-cuts.&nbsp; The name is explained
to mean &ldquo;craving
glory,&rdquo;&mdash;Glori&aelig;memor.&nbsp; The Germans laugh to
scorn a French translator, who rendered it
&ldquo;Chermerci.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was annotated very soon after
its publication, and each exploit explained and accounted
for.&nbsp; It is remarkable and touching in a man who married at
eighteen, and was a widower at twenty-two, that, in both books,
the happy union with his lady love is placed at the end&mdash;not
at the beginning of the book; and in <i>Theurdank</i>, at least,
the eternal reunion is clearly meant.</p>
<p>In this curious book, K&ouml;nig R&ouml;mreich, by whom every
contemporary understood poor Charles of Burgundy&mdash;thus
posthumously made King of Rome by Maximilian, as the only honour
in his power, betroths his daughter Ehrenreich (rich in honour)
to the Ritter Theurdank.&nbsp; Soon after, by a most mild version
of Duke Charles&rsquo;s frightful end, K&ouml;nig R&ouml;mreich
is seen on his back dying in a garden, and Ehrenreich (as Mary
really did) despatches a ring to summon her betrothed.</p>
<p>But here Theurdank returns for answer that he means first to
win honour by his exploits, and sets out with his comrade,
Ehrenhold, in search thereof.&nbsp; Ehrenhold never appears of
the smallest use to him in any of the dire adventures into which
he falls, but only stands complacently by, and in effect may
represent Fame, or perhaps that literary sage whom Don Quixote
always supposed to be at hand to record his deeds of prowess.</p>
<p>Next we are presented with the German impersonation of Satan
as a wise old magician, only with claws instead of feet,
commissioning his three captains (<i>hauptleutern</i>),
F&uuml;rwitz, Umfallo, and Neidelhard, to beset and ruin
Theurdank.&nbsp; They are interpreted as the dangers of youth,
middle life, and old age&mdash;Rashness, Disaster, and Distress
(or Envy).&nbsp; One at a time they encounter him,&mdash;not
once, but again and again; and he has ranged under each head, in
entire contempt of real order of time, the perils he thinks owing
to each foe.&nbsp; F&uuml;rwitz most justly gets the credit of
Maximilian&rsquo;s perils on the steeple of Ulm, though,
unfortunately, the artist has represented the daring climber as
standing not much above the shoulders of F&uuml;rwitz and
Ehrenhold; and although the annotation tells us that his
&ldquo;hinder half foot&rdquo; overhung the scaffold, the danger
in the print is not appalling.&nbsp; F&uuml;rwitz likewise
inveigles him into putting the point (<i>schn&auml;bel</i>) of
his shoe into the wheel of a mill for turning stone balls, where
he certainly hardly deserved to lose nothing but the beak of his
shoe.&nbsp; This enemy also brings him into numerous unpleasant
predicaments on precipices, where he hangs by one hand; while the
chamois stand delighted on every available peak, F&uuml;rwitz
grins malevolently, and Ehrenhold stands pointing at him over his
shoulder.&nbsp; Time and place are given in the notes for all
these escapes.&nbsp; After some twenty adventures F&uuml;rwitz is
beaten off, and Umfallo tries his powers.&nbsp; Here the
misadventures do not involve so much folly on the hero&rsquo;s
part&mdash;though, to be sure, he ventures into a lion&rsquo;s
den unarmed, and has to beat off the inmates with a shovel.&nbsp;
But the other adventures are more rational.&nbsp; He catches a
jester&mdash;of admirably foolish expression&mdash;putting a
match to a powder-magazine; he is wonderfully preserved in
mountain avalanches and hurricanes; reins up his horse on the
verge of an abyss; falls through ice in Holland and shows nothing
but his head above it; cures himself of a fever by draughts of
water, to the great disgust of his physicians, and escapes a fire
bursting out of a tall stove.</p>
<p>Neidelhard brings his real battles and perils.&nbsp; From this
last he is in danger of shipwreck, of assassination, of poison,
in single combat, or in battle; tumults of the people beset him;
he is imprisoned as at Ghent.&nbsp; But finally Neidelhard is
beaten back; and the hero is presented to Ehrenreich.&nbsp;
Ehrenhold recounts his triumphs, and accuses the three
captains.&nbsp; One is hung, another beheaded, the third thrown
headlong from a tower, and a guardian angel then summons
Theurdank to his union with his Queen.&nbsp; No doubt this
reunion was the life-dream of the harassed, busy, inconsistent
man, who flashed through the turmoils of the early sixteenth
century.</p>
<p>The adventures of Maximilian which have been adverted to in
the story are all to be found in Theurdank, and in his early life
he was probably the brilliant eager person we have tried in some
degree to describe.&nbsp; In his latter years it is well known
that he was much struck by Luther&rsquo;s arguments; and, indeed,
he had long been conscious of need of Church reform, though his
plans took the grotesque form of getting himself made Pope, and
taking all into his own hands.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was unwise to have ever so faintly sketched
Ebbo&rsquo;s career through the ensuing troubles; but the history
of the star and of the spark in the stubble seemed to need
completion; and the working out of the character of the survivor
was unfinished till his course had been thought over from the
dawn of the Wittenberg teaching, which must have seemed no
novelty to an heir of the doctrine of Tauler, and of the
veritably Catholic divines of old times.&nbsp; The idea is of the
supposed course of a thoughtful, refined, conscientious man
through the earlier times of the Reformation, glad of the hope of
cleansing the Church, but hoping to cleanse, not to break away
from her&mdash;a hope that Luther himself long cherished, and
which was not entirely frustrated till the re-assembly at Trent
in the next generation.&nbsp; Justice has never been done to the
men who feared to loose their hold on the Church Catholic as the
one body to which the promises were made.&nbsp; Their loyalty has
been treated as blindness, timidity, or superstition; but that
there were many such persons, and those among the very highest
minds of their time, no one can have any doubt after reading such
lives as those of Friedrich the Wise of Saxony, of Erasmus, of
Vittoria Colonna, or of Cardinal Giustiniani.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MASTER GOTTFRIED&rsquo;S
WORKSHOP</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> upper lattices of a tall,
narrow window were open, and admitted the view, of first some
richly-tinted vine leaves and purpling grapes, then, in dazzling
freshness of new white stone, the lacework fabric of a half-built
minster spire, with a mason&rsquo;s crane on the summit, bending
as though craving for a further supply of materials; and beyond,
peeping through every crevice of the exquisite open fretwork, was
the intensely blue sky of early autumn.</p>
<p>The lower longer panes of the window were closed, and the
glass, divided into circles and quarrels, made the scene less
distinct; but still the huge stone tower was traceable, and,
farther off, the slope of a gently-rising hill, clothed with
vineyards blushing into autumn richness.&nbsp; Below, the view
was closed by the gray wall of a court-yard, laden with
fruit-trees in full bearing, and inclosing paved paths that
radiated from a central fountain, and left spaces between, where
a few summer flowers still lingered, and the remains of others
showed what their past glory had been.</p>
<p>The interior of the room was wainscoted, the floor paved with
bright red and cream-coloured tiles, and the tall stove in one
corner decorated with the same.&nbsp; The eastern end of the
apartment was adorned with an exquisite small group carved in
oak, representing the carpenter&rsquo;s shop at Nazareth, with
the Holy Child instructed by Joseph in the use of tools, and the
Mother sitting with her book, &ldquo;pondering these things in
her heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; All around were blocks of wood and
carvings in varying states of progress&mdash;some scarcely shaped
out, and others in perfect completion.&nbsp; And the subjects
were equally various.&nbsp; Here was an adoring angel with folded
wings, clasped hands, and rapt face; here a majestic head of an
apostle or prophet; here a lovely virgin saint, seeming to play
smilingly with the instrument of her martyrdom; here a grotesque
<i>miserere</i> group, illustrating a fairy tale, or caricaturing
a popular fable here a beauteous festoon of flowers and fruit,
emulating nature in all save colour; and on the work-table
itself, growing under the master&rsquo;s hand, was a long wreath,
entirely composed of leaves and seed-vessels in their quaint and
beauteous forms&mdash;the heart-shaped shepherd&rsquo;s purse,
the mask-like skull-cap, and the crowned urn of the
henbane.&nbsp; The starred cap of the poppy was actually being
shaped under the tool, copied from a green capsule, surmounted
with purple velvety rays, which, together with its rough and wavy
leaf, was held in the hand of a young maiden who knelt by the
table, watching the work with eager interest.</p>
<p>She was not a beautiful girl&mdash;not one of those whose
&ldquo;bright eyes rain influence, and judge the
prize.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was too small, too slight, too retiring
for such a position.&nbsp; If there was something lily-like in
her drooping grace, it was not the queen-lily of the garden that
she resembled, but the retiring lily of the valley&mdash;so
purely, transparently white was her skin, scarcely tinted by a
roseate blush on the cheek, so tender and modest the whole effect
of her slender figure, and the soft, downcast, pensive brown
eyes, utterly dissimilar in hue from those of all her friends and
kindred, except perhaps the bright, quick ones of her uncle, the
master-carver.&nbsp; Otherwise, his portly form, open visage, and
good-natured stateliness, as well as his furred cap and gold
chain, were thoroughly those of the German burgomaster of the
fifteenth century; but those glittering black eyes had not ceased
to betray their French, or rather Walloon, origin, though for
several generations back the family had been settled at
Ulm.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, it was Walloon quickness and readiness
of wit that had made them, so soon as they became affiliated, so
prominent in all the councils of the good free city, and so noted
for excellence in art and learning.&nbsp; Indeed the present head
of the family, Master Gottfried Sorel, was so much esteemed for
his learning that he had once had serious thoughts of terming
himself Magister Gothofredus Oxalicus, and might have carried it
out but for the very decided objections of his wife, Dame
Johanna, and his little niece, Christina, to being dubbed by any
such surname.</p>
<p>Master Gottfried had had a scapegrace younger brother named
Hugh, who had scorned both books and tools, had been the plague
of the workshop, and, instead of coming back from his wandering
year of improvement, had joined a band of roving
Lanzknechts.&nbsp; No more had been heard of him for a dozen or
fifteen years, when he suddenly arrived at the paternal mansion
at Ulm, half dead with intermittent fever, and with a young,
broken-hearted, and nearly expiring wife, his spoil in his
Italian campaigns.&nbsp; His rude affection had utterly failed to
console her for her desolated home and slaughtered kindred, and
it had so soon turned to brutality that, when brought to
comparative peace and rest in his brother&rsquo;s home, there was
nothing left for the poor Italian but to lie down and die,
commending her babe in broken German to Hausfrau Johanna, and
blessing Master Gottfried for his flowing Latin assurances that
the child should be to them even as the little maiden who was
lying in the God&rsquo;s acre upon the hillside.</p>
<p>And verily the little Christina had been a precious gift to
the bereaved couple.&nbsp; Her father had no sooner recovered
than he returned to his roving life, and, except for a report
that he had been seen among the retainers of one of the robber
barons of the Swabian Alps, nothing had been heard of him; and
Master Gottfried only hoped to be spared the actual pain and
scandal of knowing when his eyes were blinded and his head swept
off at a blow, or when he was tumbled headlong into a moat,
suspended from a tree, or broken on the wheel: a choice of fates
that was sure sooner or later to befall him.&nbsp; Meantime, both
the burgomeister and burgomeisterinn did their utmost to forget
that the gentle little girl was not their own; they set all their
hopes and joys on her, and, making her supply the place at once
of son and daughter, they bred her up in all the refinements and
accomplishments in which the free citizens of Germany took the
lead in the middle and latter part of the fifteenth
century.&nbsp; To aid her aunt in all house-wifely arts, to
prepare dainty food and varied liquors, and to spin, weave, and
broider, was only a part of Christina&rsquo;s training; her uncle
likewise set great store by her sweet Italian voice, and caused
her to be carefully taught to sing and play on the lute, and he
likewise delighted in hearing her read aloud to him from the
hereditary store of MSS. and from the dark volumes that began to
proceed from the press.&nbsp; Nay, Master Gottfried had made
experiments in printing and wood-engraving on his own account,
and had found no head so intelligent, no hand so desirous to aid
him, as his little Christina&rsquo;s, who, in all that needed
taste and skill rather than strength, was worth all his prentices
and journeymen together.&nbsp; Some fine bold wood-cuts had been
produced by their joint efforts; but these less important
occupations had of late been set aside by the engrossing interest
of the interior fittings of the great &ldquo;Dome Kirk,&rdquo;
which for nearly a century had been rising by the united
exertions of the burghers, without any assistance from
without.&nbsp; The foundation had been laid in 1377; and at
length, in the year of grace 1472, the crown of the apse had been
closed in, and matters were so forward that Master
Gottfried&rsquo;s stall work was already in requisition for the
choir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cubits more,&rdquo; he reckoned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Child, hast thou found me fruits enough for the completing
of this border?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, mine uncle.&nbsp; I have the wild rosehip, and
the flat shield of the moonwort, and a pea-pod, and more whose
names I know not.&nbsp; But should they all be seed and
fruit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, truly, my Stina, for this wreath shall speak of
the goodly fruits of a completed life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even as that which you carved in spring told of the
blossom and fair promise of youth,&rdquo; returned the
maiden.&nbsp; &ldquo;Methinks the one is the most beautiful, as
it ought to be;&rdquo; then, after a little pause, and some
reckoning, &ldquo;I have scarce seed-pods enough in store, uncle;
might we not seek some rarer shapes in the herb-garden of Master
Gerhard, the physician?&nbsp; He, too, might tell me the names of
some of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, child; or we might ride into the country beyond
the walls, and seek them.&nbsp; What, little one, wouldst thou
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we go not far,&rdquo; faltered Christina,
colouring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, thou hast not forgotten the fright thy companions
had from the Schlangenwald reitern when gathering Maydew?&nbsp;
Fear not, little coward; if we go beyond the suburbs we will take
Hans and Peter with their halberts.&nbsp; But I believe thy silly
little heart can scarce be free for enjoyment if it can fancy a
Reiter within a dozen leagues of thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your side I would not fear.&nbsp; That is, I would
not vex thee by my folly, and I might forget it,&rdquo; replied
Christina, looking down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gentle child!&rdquo; the old man said
approvingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Moreover, if our good Raiser has his
way, we shall soon be free of the reitern of Schlangenwald, and
Adlerstein, and all the rest of the mouse-trap barons.&nbsp; He
is hoping to form a league of us free imperial cities with all
the more reasonable and honest nobles, to preserve the peace of
the country.&nbsp; Even now a letter from him was read in the
Town Hall to that effect; and, when all are united against them,
my lords-mousers must needs become pledged to the league, or go
down before it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that will be well,&rdquo; cried Christina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then will our wagons be no longer set upon at the
Debateable Ford by Schlangenwald or Adlerstein; and our wares
will come safely, and there will be wealth enough to raise our
spire!&nbsp; O uncle, what a day of joy will that be when Our
Lady&rsquo;s great statue will be set on the summit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A day that I shall scarce see, and it will be well if
thou dost,&rdquo; returned her uncle, &ldquo;unless the hearts of
the burghers of Ulm return to the liberality of their fathers,
who devised that spire!&nbsp; But what trampling do I
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was indeed a sudden confusion in the house, and, before
the uncle and niece could rise, the door was opened by a
prosperous apple-faced dame, exclaiming in a hasty whisper,
&ldquo;Housefather, O Housefather, there are a troop of reitern
at the door, dismounting already;&rdquo; and, as the master came
forward, brushing from his furred vest the shavings and dust of
his work, she added in a more furtive, startled accent,
&ldquo;and, if I mistake not, one is thy brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is welcome,&rdquo; replied Master Gottfried, in his
cheery fearless voice; &ldquo;he brought us a choice gift last
time he came; and it may be he is ready to seek peace among us
after his wanderings.&nbsp; Come hither, Christina, my little
one; it is well to be abashed, but thou art not a child who need
fear to meet a father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina&rsquo;s extreme timidity, however, made her pale and
crimson by turns, perhaps by the infection of anxiety from her
aunt, who could not conceal a certain dissatisfaction and alarm,
as the maiden, led on either side by her adopted parents, thus
advanced from the little studio into a handsomely-carved wooden
gallery, projecting into a great wainscoated room, with a broad
carved stair leading down into it.&nbsp; Down this stair the
three proceeded, and reached the stone hall that lay beyond it,
just as there entered from the trellised porch, that covered the
steps into the street, a thin wiry man, in a worn and greasy buff
suit, guarded on the breast and arms with rusty steel, and a
battered helmet with the vizor up, disclosing a weather-beaten
bronzed face, with somewhat wild dark eyes, and a huge grizzled
moustache forming a straight line over his lips.&nbsp; Altogether
he was a complete model of the lawless Reiter or Lanzknecht, the
terror of Swabia, and the bugbear of Christina&rsquo;s
imagination.&nbsp; The poor child&rsquo;s heart died within her
as she perceived the mutual recognition between her uncle and the
new comer; and, while Master Gottfried held out his hands with a
cordial greeting of &ldquo;Welcome, home, brother Hugh,&rdquo;
she trembled from head to foot, as she sank on her knees, and
murmured, &ldquo;Your blessing, honoured father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha?&nbsp; What, this is my girl?&nbsp; What says
she?&nbsp; My blessing, eh?&nbsp; There then, thou hast it,
child, such as I have to give, though they&rsquo;ll tell thee at
Adlerstein that I am more wont to give the other sort of
blessing!&nbsp; Now, give me a kiss, girl, and let me see
thee!&nbsp; How now!&rdquo; as he folded her in his rough arms;
&ldquo;thou art a mere feather, as slight as our sick Jungfrau
herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, regarding her, as she stood
drooping, &ldquo;Thou art not half the woman thy mother
was&mdash;she was stately and straight as a column, and tall
withal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; replied Hausfrau Johanna, in a marked
tone; &ldquo;but both she and her poor babe had been so harassed
and wasted with long journeys and hardships, that with all our
care of our Christina, she has never been strong or
well-grown.&nbsp; The marvel is that she lived at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Christina is not beautiful, we know,&rdquo; added
her uncle, reassuringly taking her hand; &ldquo;but she is a good
and meek maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; returned the Lanzknecht, &ldquo;she
will answer the purpose well enough, or better than if she were
fair enough to set all our fellows together by the ears for
her.&nbsp; Camilla, I say&mdash;no, what&rsquo;s her name,
Christina?&mdash;put up thy gear and be ready to start with me
to-morrow morning for Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Adlerstein?&rdquo; re-echoed the housemother, in a
tone of horrified dismay; and Christina would have dropped on the
floor but for her uncle&rsquo;s sustaining hand, and the cheering
glance with which he met her imploring look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us come up to the gallery, and understand what you
desire, brother,&rdquo; said Master Gottfried, gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fill the cup of greeting, Hans.&nbsp; Your followers shall
be entertained in the hall,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; quoth Hugh, &ldquo;I will show you
reason over a goblet of the old Rosenburg.&nbsp; Is it all gone
yet, brother Goetz?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; I reckon there would not be
the scouring of a glass left of it in a week if it were at
Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the trooper crossed the lower room, which contained
a huge tiled baking oven, various brilliantly-burnished cooking
utensils, and a great carved cupboard like a wooden bedstead,
and, passing the door of the bathroom, clanked up the oaken
stairs to the gallery, the reception-room of the house.&nbsp; It
had tapestry hangings to the wall, and cushions both to the
carved chairs and deep windows, which looked out into the street,
the whole storey projecting into close proximity with the
corresponding apartment of the Syndic Moritz, the goldsmith on
the opposite side.&nbsp; An oaken table stood in the centre, and
the gallery was adorned with a dresser, displaying not only
bright pewter, but goblets and drinking cups of
beautifully-shaped and coloured glass, and saltcellars, tankards,
&amp;c. of gold and silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as it was in the old man&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; said
the soldier, throwing himself into the housefather&rsquo;s
chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;A handful of Lanzknechts would make short
work with your pots and pans, good sister Johanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; said poor Johanna under her
breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Much good they do you, up in a row there,
making you a slave to furbishing them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more
sense in a chair like this&mdash;that does rest a man&rsquo;s
bones.&nbsp; Here, Camilla, girl, unlace my helmet!&nbsp; What,
know&rsquo;st not how?&nbsp; What is a woman made for but to let
a soldier free of his trappings?&nbsp; Thou hast done it!&nbsp;
There!&nbsp; Now my boots,&rdquo; stretching out his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans shall draw off your boots, fair brother,&rdquo;
began the dame; but poor Christina, the more anxious to
propitiate him in little things, because of the horror and dread
with which his main purpose inspired her, was already on her
knees, pulling with her small quivering hands at the long
steel-guarded boot&mdash;a task to which she would have been
utterly inadequate, but for some lazy assistance from her
father&rsquo;s other foot.&nbsp; She further brought a pair of
her uncle&rsquo;s furred slippers, while Reiter Hugh proceeded to
dangle one of the boots in the air, expatiating on its frail
condition, and expressing his intention of getting a new pair
from Master Matthias, the sutor, ere he should leave Ulm on the
morrow.&nbsp; Then, again, came the dreaded subject; his daughter
must go with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you with Christina, brother?&rdquo; gravely
asked Master Gottfried, seating himself on the opposite side of
the stove, while out of sight the frightened girl herself knelt
on the floor, her head on her aunt&rsquo;s knees, trying to
derive comfort from Dame Johanna&rsquo;s clasping hands, and
vehement murmurs that they would not let their child be taken
from them.&nbsp; Alas! these assurances were little in accordance
with Hugh&rsquo;s rough reply, &ldquo;And what is it to you what
I do with mine own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this, that, having bred her up as my child and
intended heiress, I might have some voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! in choosing her mate!&nbsp; Some mincing artificer,
I trow, fiddling away with wood and wire to make gauds for the
fair-day!&nbsp; Hast got him here?&nbsp; If I like him, and she
likes him, I&rsquo;ll bring her back when her work is
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such person as yet in the case,&rdquo; said
Gottfried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christina is not yet seventeen, and I
would take my time to find an honest, pious burgher, who will
value this precious jewel of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let her polish his flagons to the end of her
days,&rdquo; laughed Hugh grimly, but manifestly somewhat
influenced by the notion of his brother&rsquo;s wealth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What, hast no child of thine own?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, save in Paradise,&rdquo; answered Gottfried,
crossing himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thus, if Christina should
remain with me, and be such as I would have her, then, brother,
my wealth, after myself and my good housewife, shall be hers,
with due provision for thee, if thou shouldst weary of thy wild
life.&nbsp; Otherwise,&rdquo; he added, looking down, and
speaking in an under tone, &ldquo;my poor savings should go to
the completion of the Dome Kirk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who told thee, Goetz, that I would do ought with
the girl that should hinder her from being the very same fat,
sourkrout-cooking, pewter-scrubbing housewife of thy mind&rsquo;s
eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing of thy designs as yet, brother
Hugh, save that thou wouldst take her to Adlerstein, which men
greatly belie if it be not a nest of robbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! thou hast heard of Adlerstein!&nbsp; We have made
the backs of your jolly merchants tingle as well as they could
through their well-lined doublets!&nbsp; Ulm knows of Adlerstein,
and the Debateable Ford!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It knows little to its credit,&rdquo; said Gottfried,
gravely; &ldquo;and it knows also that the Emperor is about to
make a combination against all the Swabian robber-holds, and that
such as join not in it will fare the worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Kaiser Fritz catch his bear ere he sells its
hide!&nbsp; He has never tried to mount the Eagle&rsquo;s
Ladder!&nbsp; Why, man, Adlerstein might be held against five
hundred men by sister Johanna with her rock and spindle!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a free barony, Master Gottfried, I tell thee&mdash;has
never sworn allegiance to Kaiser or Duke of Swabia either!&nbsp;
Freiherr Eberhard is as much a king on his own rock as Kaiser
Fritz ever was of the Romans, and more too, for I never could
find out that they thought much of our king at Rome; and, as to
gainsaying our old Freiherr, one might as well leap over the
abyss at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those old free barons are pitiless tyrants,&rdquo;
said Gottfried, &ldquo;and I scarce think I can understand thee
aright when I hear thee say thou wouldst carry thy daughter to
such an abode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Freiherr&rsquo;s command,&rdquo; returned
Hugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look you, they have had wondrous ill-luck with
their children; the Freiherrinn Kunigunde has had a dozen at
least, and only two are alive, my young Freiherr and my young
Lady Ermentrude; and no wonder, you would say, if you could see
the gracious Freiherrinn, for surely Dame Holda made a blunder
when she fished her out of the fountain woman instead of
man.&nbsp; She is Adlerstein herself by birth, married her
cousin, and is prouder and more dour than our old Freiherr
himself&mdash;fitter far to handle shield than swaddled
babe.&nbsp; And now our Jungfrau has fallen into a pining waste,
that &rsquo;tis a pity to see how her cheeks have fallen away,
and how she mopes and fades.&nbsp; Now, the old Freiherr and her
brother, they both dote on her, and would do anything for
her.&nbsp; They thought she was bewitched, so we took old Mother
Ilsebill and tried her with the ordeal of water; but, look you,
she sank as innocent as a puppy dog, and Ursel was at fault to
fix on any one else.&nbsp; Then one day, when I looked into the
chamber, I saw the poor maiden sitting, with her head hanging
down, as if &rsquo;twas too heavy for her, on a high-backed
chair, no rest for her feet, and the wind blowing keen all round
her, and nothing to taste but scorched beef, or black bread and
sour wine, and her mother rating her for foolish fancies that
gave trouble.&nbsp; And, when my young Freiherr was bemoaning
himself that we could not hear of a Jew physician passing our way
to catch and bring up to cure her, I said to him at last that no
doctor could do for her what gentle tendance and nursing would,
for what the poor maiden needed was to be cosseted and laid down
softly, and fed with broths and possets, and all that women know
how to do with one another.&nbsp; A proper scowl and hard words I
got from my gracious Lady, for wanting to put burgher softness
into an Adlerstein; but my old lord and his son opened on the
scent at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou hast a daughter?&rsquo; quoth
the Freiherr.&nbsp; &lsquo;So please your gracious
lordship,&rsquo; quoth I; &lsquo;that is, if she still lives, for
I left her a puny infant.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said
my lord, &lsquo;if thou wilt bring her here, and her care
restores my daughter to health and strength, then will I make
thee my body squire, with a right to a fourth part of all the
spoil, and feed for two horses in my stable.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
young Freiherr Eberhard gave his word upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gottfried suggested that a sick nurse was the person required
rather than a child like Christina; but, as Hugh truly observed,
no nurse would voluntarily go to Adlerstein, and it was no use to
wait for the hopes of capturing one by raid or foray.&nbsp; His
daughter was at his own disposal, and her services would be
repaid by personal advantages to himself which he was not
disposed to forego; in effect these were the only means that the
baron had of requiting any attendance upon his daughter.</p>
<p>The citizens of old Germany had the strongest and most
stringent ideas of parental authority, and regarded daughters as
absolute chattels of their father; and Master Gottfried Sorel,
though he alone had done the part of a parent to his niece, felt
entirely unable to withstand the nearer claim, except by
representations; and these fell utterly disregarded, as in truth
every counsel had hitherto done, upon the ears of Reiter Hugh,
ever since he had emerged from his swaddling clothes.&nbsp; The
plentiful supper, full cup of wine, the confections, the soft
chair, together perhaps with his brother&rsquo;s grave speech,
soon, however, had the effect of sending him into a doze, whence
he started to accept civilly the proposal of being installed in
the stranger&rsquo;s room, where he was speedily snoring between
two feather beds.</p>
<p>Then there could be freedom of speech in the gallery, where
the uncle and aunt held anxious counsel over the poor little
dark-tressed head that still lay upon good Johanna&rsquo;s
knees.&nbsp; The dame was indignant and resolute: &ldquo;Take the
child back with him into a very nest of robbers!&mdash;her own
innocent dove whom they had shielded from all evil like a very
nun in a cloister!&nbsp; She should as soon think of yielding her
up to be borne off by the great Satan himself with his horns and
hoofs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh is her father, housewife,&rdquo; said the
master-carver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right of parents is with those that have done the
duty of parents,&rdquo; returned Johanna.&nbsp; &ldquo;What said
the kid in the fable to the goat that claimed her from the sheep
that bred her up?&nbsp; I am ashamed of you, housefather, for not
better loving your own niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows how I love her,&rdquo; said Gottfried, as
the sweet face was raised up to him with a look acquitting him of
the charge, and he bent to smooth back the silken hair, and kiss
the ivory brow; &ldquo;but Heaven also knows that I see no means
of withholding her from one whose claim is closer than my
own&mdash;none save one; and to that even thou, housemother,
wouldst not have me resort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the dame, sharply, yet with
some fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To denounce him to the burgomasters as one of the
Adlerstein retainers who robbed Philipp der Schmidt, and have him
fast laid by the heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina shuddered, and Dame Johanna herself recoiled; but
presently exclaimed, &ldquo;Nay, you could not do that, good man,
but wherefore not threaten him therewith?&nbsp; Stand at his
bedside in early dawn, and tell him that, if he be not off ere
daylight with both his cut-throats, the halberdiers will be upon
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Threaten what I neither could nor would perform,
mother?&nbsp; That were a shrewish resource.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet would it save the child,&rdquo; muttered
Johanna.&nbsp; But, in the meantime, Christina was rising from
the floor, and stood before them with loose hair, tearful eyes,
and wet, flushed cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be thus,&rdquo; she
said, in a low, but not unsteady voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can bear
it better since I have heard of the poor young lady, sick and
with none to care for her.&nbsp; I will go with my father; it is
my duty.&nbsp; I will do my best; but oh! uncle, so work with him
that he may bring me back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This from thee, Stina!&rdquo; exclaimed her aunt;
&ldquo;from thee who art sick for fear of a
lanzknecht!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The saints will be with me, and you will pray for
me,&rdquo; said Christina, still trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell thee, child, thou knowst not what these vile
dens are.&nbsp; Heaven forfend thou shouldst!&rdquo; exclaimed
her aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go only to Father Balthazar, housefather,
and see if he doth not call it a sending of a lamb among
wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind&rsquo;st thou the carving I did for Father
Balthazar&rsquo;s own oratory?&rdquo; replied Master
Gottfried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talk not of carving!&nbsp; I talk of our
child!&rdquo; said the dame, petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ut agnus inter lupos</i>,&rdquo; softly said
Gottfried, looking tenderly, though sadly, at his niece, who not
only understood the quotation, but well remembered the carving of
the cross-marked lamb going forth from its fold among the howling
wolves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I am not an apostle,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, in the path of duty, &rsquo;tis the same hand
that sends thee forth,&rdquo; answered her uncle, &ldquo;and the
same will guard thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duty, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Johanna.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
if any duty could lead that silly helpless child among that herd
of evil men, and women yet worse, with a good-for-nothing father,
who would sell her for a good horse to the first dissolute Junker
who fell in his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take care that he knows it is worth his while to
restore her safe to us.&nbsp; Nor do I think so ill of Hugh as
thou dost, mother.&nbsp; And, for the rest, Heaven and the saints
and her own discretion must be her guard till she shall return to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can Heaven be expected to protect her when you are
flying in its face by not taking counsel with Father
Balthazar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shalt thou do,&rdquo; replied Gottfried, readily,
secure that Father Balthazar would see the matter in the same
light as himself, and tranquillize the good woman.&nbsp; It was
not yet so late but that a servant could be despatched with a
request that Father Balthazar, who lived not many houses off in
the same street, would favour the Burgomeisterinn Sorel by coming
to speak with her.&nbsp; In a few minutes he appeared,&mdash;an
aged man, with a sensible face, of the fresh pure bloom preserved
by a temperate life.&nbsp; He was a secular parish-priest, and,
as well as his friend Master Gottfried, held greatly by the views
left by the famous Strasburg preacher, Master John Tauler.&nbsp;
After the good housemother had, in strong terms, laid the case
before him, she expected a trenchant decision on her own side,
but, to her surprise and disappointment, he declared that Master
Gottfried was right, and that, unless Hugh Sorel demanded
anything absolutely sinful of his daughter, it was needful that
she should submit.&nbsp; He repeated, in stronger terms, the
assurance that she would be protected in the endeavour to do
right, and the Divine promises which he quoted from the Latin
Scriptures gave some comfort to the niece, who understood them,
while they impressed the aunt, who did not.&nbsp; There was
always the hope that, whether the young lady died or recovered,
the conclusion of her illness would be the term of
Christina&rsquo;s stay at Adlerstein, and with this trust Johanna
must content herself.&nbsp; The priest took leave, after
appointing with Christina to meet her in the confessional early
in the morning before mass; and half the night was spent by the
aunt and niece in preparing Christina&rsquo;s wardrobe for her
sudden journey.</p>
<p>Many a tear was shed over the tokens of the little services
she was wont to render, her half-done works, and pleasant studies
so suddenly broken off, and all the time Hausfrau Johanna was
running on with a lecture on the diligent preservation of her
maiden discretion, with plentiful warnings against swaggering
men-at-arms, drunken lanzknechts, and, above all, against young
barons, who most assuredly could mean no good by any burgher
maiden.&nbsp; The good aunt blessed the saints that her Stina was
likely only to be lovely in affectionate home eyes; but, for that
matter, idle men, shut up in a castle, with nothing but mischief
to think of, would be dangerous to Little Three Eyes herself, and
Christina had best never stir a yard from her lady&rsquo;s chair,
when forced to meet them.&nbsp; All this was interspersed with
motherly advice how to treat the sick lady, and receipts for
cordials and possets; for Johanna began to regard the case as a
sort of second-hand one of her own.&nbsp; Nay, she even turned it
over in her mind whether she should not offer herself as the Lady
Ermentrude&rsquo;s sick-nurse, as being a less dangerous
commodity than her little niece: but fears for the well-being of
the master-carver, and his Wirthschaft, and still more the notion
of gossip Gertrude Grundt hearing that she had ridden off with a
wild lanzknecht, made her at once reject the plan, without even
mentioning it to her husband or his niece.</p>
<p>By the time Hugh Sorel rolled out from between his feather
beds, and was about to don his greasy buff, a handsome new suit,
finished point device, and a pair of huge boots to correspond,
had been laid by his bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&nbsp; Master Goetz,&rdquo; said he, as he
stumbled into the Stube, &ldquo;I see thy game.&nbsp; Thou
wouldst make it worth my while to visit the father-house at
Ulm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be worth thy while, indeed, if thou bringest
me back my white dove,&rdquo; was Gottfried&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how if I bring her back with a strapping reiter
son-in-law?&rdquo; laughed Hugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;What welcome should
the fellow receive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would depend on what he might be,&rdquo; replied
Gottfried; and Hugh, his love of tormenting a little allayed by
satisfaction in his buff suit, and by an eye to a heavy purse
that lay by his brother&rsquo;s hand on the table, added,
&ldquo;Little fear of that.&nbsp; Our fellows would look for
lustier brides than yon little pale face.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis whiter
than ever this morning,&mdash;but no tears.&nbsp; That is my
brave girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father, I am ready to do your bidding,&rdquo;
replied Christina, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well, child.&nbsp; Mark me, no tears.&nbsp; Thy
mother wept day and night, and, when she had wept out her tears,
she was sullen, when I would have been friendly towards
her.&nbsp; It was the worse for her.&nbsp; But, so long as thou
art good daughter to me, thou shalt find me good father to
thee;&rdquo; and for a moment there was a kindliness in his eye
which made it sufficiently like that of his brother to give some
consolation to the shrinking heart that he was rending from all
it loved; and she steadied her voice for another gentle
profession of obedience, for which she felt strengthened by the
morning&rsquo;s orisons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, child.&nbsp; Now canst sit on old
Nibelung&rsquo;s croup?&nbsp; His back-bone is somewhat sharper
than if he had battened in a citizen&rsquo;s stall; but, if thine
aunt can find thee some sort of pillion, I&rsquo;ll promise thee
the best ride thou hast had since we came from Innspruck, ere
thou canst remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christina has her own mule,&rdquo; replied her uncle,
&ldquo;without troubling Nibelung to carry double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! her own!&nbsp; An overfed burgomaster sort of a
beast, that will turn restive at the first sight of the
Eagle&rsquo;s Ladder!&nbsp; However, he may carry her so far,
and, if we cannot get him up the mountain, I shall know what to
do with him,&rdquo; he muttered to himself.</p>
<p>But Hugh, like many a gentleman after him, was recusant at the
sight of his daughter&rsquo;s luggage; and yet it only loaded one
sumpter mule, besides forming a few bundles which could be easily
bestowed upon the saddles of his two knappen, while her lute hung
by a silken string on her arm.&nbsp; Both she and her aunt
thought she had been extremely moderate; but his cry was, What
could she want with so much?&nbsp; Her mother had never been
allowed more than would go into a pair of saddle-bags; and his
own Jungfrau&mdash;she had never seen so much gear together in
her life; he would be laughed to scorn for his presumption in
bringing such a fine lady into the castle; it would be well if
Freiherr Eberhard&rsquo;s bride brought half as much.</p>
<p>Still he had a certain pride in it&mdash;he was, after all, by
birth and breeding a burgher&mdash;and there had been evidently a
softening and civilizing influence in the night spent beneath his
paternal roof, and old habits, and perhaps likewise in the
submission he had met with from his daughter.&nbsp; The
attendants, too, who had been pleased with their quarters,
readily undertook to carry their share of the burthen, and,
though he growled and muttered a little, he at length was won
over to consent, chiefly, as it seemed, by Christina&rsquo;s
obliging readiness to leave behind the bundle that contained her
holiday kirtle.</p>
<p>He had been spared all needless irritation.&nbsp; Before his
waking, Christina had been at the priest&rsquo;s cell, and had
received his last blessings and counsels, and she had, on the way
back, exchanged her farewells and tears with her two dearest
friends, Barbara Schmidt, and Regina Grundt, confiding to the
former her cage of doves, and to the latter the myrtle, which,
like every German maiden, she cherished in her window, to supply
her future bridal wreath.&nbsp; Now pale as death, but so
resolutely composed as to be almost disappointing to her
demonstrative aunt, she quietly went through her home partings;
while Hausfrau Johanna adjured her father by all that was sacred
to be a true guardian and protector of the child, and he could
not forbear from a few tormenting auguries about the lanzknecht
son-in-law.&nbsp; Their effect was to make the good dame more
passionate in her embraces and admonitions to Christina to take
care of herself.&nbsp; She would have a mass said every day that
Heaven might have a care of her!</p>
<p>Master Gottfried was going to ride as far as the confines of
the free city&rsquo;s territory, and his round, sleek,
cream-coloured palfrey, used to ambling in civic processions, was
as great a contrast to raw-boned, wild-eyed Nibelung, all dappled
with misty grey, as was the stately, substantial burgher to his
lean, hungry-looking brother, or Dame Johanna&rsquo;s dignified,
curled, white poodle, which was forcibly withheld from following
Christina, to the coarse-bristled, wolfish-looking hound who
glared at the household pet with angry and contemptuous eyes, and
made poor Christina&rsquo;s heart throb with terror whenever it
bounded near her.</p>
<p>Close to her uncle she kept, as beneath the trellised porches
that came down from the projecting gables of the burghers&rsquo;
houses many a well-known face gazed and nodded, as they took
their way through the crooked streets, many a beggar or poor
widow waved her a blessing.&nbsp; Out into the market-place, with
its clear fountain adorned with arches and statues, past the
rising Dome Kirk, where the swarms of workmen unbonneted to the
master-carver, and the reiter paused with an irreverent sneer at
the small progress made since he could first remember the
building.&nbsp; How poor little Christina&rsquo;s soul clung to
every cusp of the lacework spire, every arch of the window, each
of which she had hailed as an achievement!&nbsp; The tears had
well-nigh blinded her in a gush of feeling that came on her
unawares, and her mule had his own way as he carried her under
the arch of the tall and beautifully-sculptured bridge tower, and
over the noble bridge across the Danube.</p>
<p>Her uncle spoke much, low and earnestly, to his brother.&nbsp;
She knew it was in commendation of her to his care, and an
endeavour to impress him with a sense of the kind of protection
she would require, and she kept out of earshot.&nbsp; It was
enough for her to see her uncle still, and feel that his
tenderness was with her, and around her.&nbsp; But at last he
drew his rein.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, my little one, the daughter
of my heart, I must bid thee farewell,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Christina could not be restrained from springing from her
mule, and kneeling on the grass to receive his blessing, her face
hidden in her hands, that her father might not see her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good God bless thee, my child,&rdquo; said
Gottfried, who seldom invoked the saints; &ldquo;bless thee, and
bring thee back in His own good time.&nbsp; Thou hast been a good
child to us; be so to thine own father.&nbsp; Do thy work, and
come back to us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears rained down his cheeks, as Christina&rsquo;s head
lay on his bosom, and then with a last kiss he lifted her again
on her mule, mounted his horse, and turned back to the city, with
his servant.</p>
<p>Hugh was merciful enough to let his daughter gaze long after
the retreating figure ere he summoned her on.&nbsp; All day they
rode, at first through meadow lands and then through more broken,
open ground, where at mid-day they halted, and dined upon the
plentiful fare with which the housemother had provided them, over
which Hugh smacked his lips, and owned that they did live well in
the old town!&nbsp; Could Christina make such sausages?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as well as my aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do thy best, and thou wilt win favour with the
baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening began to advance, and Christina was very weary, as
the purple mountains that she had long watched with a mixture of
fear and hope began to look more distinct, and the ground was
often in abrupt ascents.&nbsp; Her father, without giving space
for complaints, hurried her on.&nbsp; He must reach the
Debateable Ford ere dark.&nbsp; It was, however, twilight when
they came to an open space, where, at the foot of thickly
forest-clad rising ground, lay an expanse of turf and rich grass,
through which a stream made its way, standing in a wide tranquil
pool as if to rest after its rough course from the
mountains.&nbsp; Above rose, like a dark wall, crag upon crag,
peak on peak, in purple masses, blending with the sky; and Hugh,
pointing upwards to a turreted point, apparently close above
their heads, where a star of light was burning, told her that
there was Adlerstein, and this was the Debateable Ford.</p>
<p>In fact, as he explained, while splashing through the shallow
expanse, the stream had changed its course.&nbsp; It was the
boundary between the lands of Schlangenwald and Adlerstein, but
it had within the last sixty years burst forth in a flood, and
had then declined to return to its own bed, but had flowed in a
fresh channel to the right of the former one.&nbsp; The
Freiherren von Adlerstein claimed the ground to the old channel,
the Graffen von Schlangenwald held that the river was the
landmark; and the dispute had a greater importance than seemed
explained from the worth of the rushy space of ground in
question, for this was the passage of the Italian merchants on
their way from Constance, and every load that was overthrown in
the river was regarded as the lawful prey of the noble on whose
banks the catastrophe befell.</p>
<p>Any freight of goods was anxiously watched by both nobles, and
it was not their fault if no disaster befell the
travellers.&nbsp; Hugh talked of the Schlangenwald marauders with
the bitterness of a deadly feud, but manifestly did not breathe
freely till his whole convoy were safe across both the wet and
the dry channel.</p>
<p>Christina supposed they should now ascend to the castle; but
her father laughed, saying that the castle was not such a step
off as she fancied, and that they must have daylight for the
Eagle&rsquo;s Stairs.&nbsp; He led the way through the trees, up
ground that she thought mountain already, and finally arrived at
a miserable little hut, which served the purpose of an inn.</p>
<p>He was received there with much obsequiousness, and was
plainly a great authority there.&nbsp; Christina, weary and
frightened, descended from her mule, and was put under the
protection of a wild, rough-looking peasant woman, who stared at
her like something from another world, but at length showed her a
nook behind a mud partition, where she could spread her mantle,
and at least lie down, and tell her beads unseen, if she could
not sleep in the stifling, smoky atmosphere, amid the sounds of
carousal among her father and his fellows.</p>
<p>The great hound came up and smelt to her.&nbsp; His outline
was so-wolfish, that she had nearly screamed: but, more in terror
at the men who might have helped her than even at the beast, she
tried to smooth him with her trembling hand, whispered his name
of &ldquo;Festhold,&rdquo; and found him licking her hand, and
wagging his long rough tail.&nbsp; And he finally lay down at her
feet, as though to protect her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a sign that good angels will not let me be
hurt?&rdquo; she thought, and, wearied out, she slept.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EYRIE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Christina Sorel</span> awoke to a scene
most unlike that which had been wont to meet her eyes in her own
little wainscoted chamber high in the gabled front of her
uncle&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; It was a time when the imperial free
towns of Germany had advanced nearly as far as those of Italy in
civilization, and had reached a point whence they retrograded
grievously during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, even to an extent
that they have never entirely recovered.&nbsp; The country
immediately around them shared the benefits of their
civilization, and the free peasant-proprietors lived in great
ease and prosperity, in beautiful and picturesque farmsteads,
enjoying a careless abundance, and keeping numerous rural or
religious feasts, where old Teutonic mythological observances had
received a Christian colouring and adaptation.</p>
<p>In the mountains, or around the castles, it was usually very
different.&nbsp; The elective constitution of the empire, the
frequent change of dynasty, the many disputed successions, had
combined to render the sovereign authority uncertain and feeble,
and it was seldom really felt save in the hereditary dominions of
the Kaiser for the time being.&nbsp; Thus, while the cities
advanced in the power of self-government, and the education it
conveyed, the nobles, especially those whose abodes were not
easily accessible, were often practically under no government at
all, and felt themselves accountable to no man.&nbsp; The old
wild freedom of the Suevi, and other Teutonic tribes, still
technically, and in many cases practically, existed.&nbsp; The
Heretogen, Heerzogen, or, as we call them, Dukes, had indeed
accepted employment from the Kaiser as his generals, and had
received rewards from him; the Gerefen, or Graffen, of all kinds
were his judges, the titles of both being proofs of their holding
commissions from, and being thus dependent on, the court.&nbsp;
But the Freiherren, a word very inadequately represented by our
French term of baron, were absolutely free, &ldquo;never in
bondage to any man,&rdquo; holding their own, and owing no duty,
no office; poorer, because unendowed by the royal authority, but
holding themselves infinitely higher, than the pensioners of the
court.&nbsp; Left behind, however, by their neighbours, who did
their part by society, and advanced with it, the Freiherren had
been for the most part obliged to give up their independence and
fall into the system, but so far in the rear, that they ranked,
like the barons of France and England, as the last order of
nobility.</p>
<p>Still, however, in the wilder and more mountainous parts of
the country, some of the old families of unreduced, truly free
Freiherren lingered, their hand against every man, every
man&rsquo;s hand against them, and ever becoming more savage,
both positively and still more proportionately, as their
isolation and the general progress around them became
greater.&nbsp; The House of Austria, by gradually absorbing
hereditary states into its own possessions, was, however, in the
fifteenth century, acquiring a preponderance that rendered its
possession of the imperial throne almost a matter of inheritance,
and moreover rendered the supreme power far more effective than
it had ever previously been.&nbsp; Freidrich III. a man still in
full vigour, and with an able and enterprising son already
elected to the succession, was making his rule felt, and it was
fast becoming apparent that the days of the independent baronies
were numbered, and that the only choice that would soon be left
them would be between making terms and being forcibly
reduced.&nbsp; Von Adlerstein was one of the oldest of these free
families.&nbsp; If the lords of the Eagle&rsquo;s Stone had ever
followed the great Konrads and Freidrichs of Swabia in their
imperial days, their descendants had taken care to forget the
weakness, and believed themselves absolutely free from all
allegiance.</p>
<p>And the wildness of their territory was what might be expected
from their hostility to all outward influences.&nbsp; The hostel,
if it deserved the name, was little more than a
charcoal-burner&rsquo;s hut, hidden in the woods at the foot of
the mountain, serving as a halting-place for the
Freiherren&rsquo;s retainers ere they attempted the ascent.&nbsp;
The inhabitants were allowed to ply their trade of charring wood
in the forest on condition of supplying the castle with charcoal,
and of affording a lodging to the followers on occasions like the
present.</p>
<p>Grimy, half-clad, and brawny, with the whites of his eyes
gleaming out of his black face, Jobst the Kohler startled
Christina terribly when she came into the outer room, and met him
returning from his night&rsquo;s work, with his long stoking-pole
in his hand.&nbsp; Her father shouted with laughter at her
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou thinkest thyself in the land of the kobolds and
dwarfs, my girl!&nbsp; Never mind, thou wilt see worse than
honest Jobst before thou hast done.&nbsp; Now, eat a morsel and
be ready&mdash;mountain air will make thee hungry ere thou art at
the castle.&nbsp; And, hark thee, Jobst, thou must give
stable-room to yon sumpter-mule for the present, and let some of
my daughter&rsquo;s gear lie in the shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O father!&rdquo; exclaimed Christina, in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring it up, child, by piecemeal,&rdquo; he
said in a low voice, &ldquo;as we can; but if such a freight came
to the castle at once, my lady would have her claws on it, and
little more wouldst thou ever see thereof.&nbsp; Moreover, I
shall have enough to do to look after thee up the ascent, without
another of these city-bred beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the poor mule will be well cared for.&nbsp; I
can pay for&mdash;&rdquo; began Christina; but her father
squeezed her arm, and drowned her soft voice in his loud
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jobst will take care of the beast, as belonging to
me.&nbsp; Woe betide him, if I find it the
worse!&rdquo;&mdash;and his added imprecations seemed
unnecessary, so earnest were the asseverations of both the man
and his wife that the animal should be well cared for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you, Christina,&rdquo; said Hugh Sorel, as soon as
he had placed her on her mule, and led her out of hearing,
&ldquo;if thou hast any gold about thee, let it be the last thing
thou ownest to any living creature up there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
as she was about to speak&mdash;&ldquo;Do not even tell me.&nbsp;
I <i>will</i> not know.&rdquo;&nbsp; The caution did not add much
to Christina&rsquo;s comfort; but she presently asked,
&ldquo;Where is thy steed, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent him up to the castle with the Schneiderlein and
Yellow Lorentz,&rdquo; answered the father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
have ado enough on foot with thee before we are up the
Ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father and daughter were meantime proceeding along a dark
path through oak and birch woods, constantly ascending, until the
oak grew stunted and disappeared, and the opening glades showed
steep, stony, torrent-furrowed ramparts of hillside above them,
looking to Christina&rsquo;s eyes as if she were set to climb up
the cathedral side like a snail or a fly.&nbsp; She quite gasped
for breath at the very sight, and was told in return to wait and
see what she would yet say to the Adlerstreppe, or Eagle&rsquo;s
Ladder.&nbsp; Poor child! she had no raptures for romantic
scenery; she knew that jagged peaks made very pretty backgrounds
in illuminations, but she had much rather have been in the smooth
meadows of the environs of Ulm.&nbsp; The Danube looked much more
agreeable to her, silver-winding between its green banks, than
did the same waters leaping down with noisy voices in their
stony, worn beds to feed the river that she only knew in his
grave breadth and majesty.&nbsp; Yet, alarmed as she was, there
was something in the exhilaration and elasticity of the mountain
air that gave her an entirely new sensation of enjoyment and
life, and seemed to brace her limbs and spirits for whatever
might be before her; and, willing to show herself ready to be
gratified, she observed on the freshness and sweetness of the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou find&rsquo;st it out, child?&nbsp; Ay, &rsquo;tis
worth all the feather-beds and pouncet-boxes in Ulm; is it
not?&nbsp; That accursed Italian fever never left me till I came
up here.&nbsp; A man can scarce draw breath in your foggy meadows
below there.&nbsp; Now then, here is the view open.&nbsp; What
think you of the Eagle&rsquo;s Nest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, having passed beyond the region of wood they had come
forth upon the mountain-side.&nbsp; A not immoderately steep
slope of boggy, mossy-looking ground covered with bilberries,
cranberries, &amp;c. and with bare rocks here and there rising,
went away above out of her ken; but the path she was upon turned
round the shoulder of the mountain, and to the left, on a ledge
of rock cut off apparently on their side by a deep ravine, and
with a sheer precipice above and below it, stood a red stone
pile, with one turret far above the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is Schloss Adlerstein?&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Schloss Adlerstein; and there shalt thou be in
two hours&rsquo; time, unless the devil be more than usually
busy, or thou mak&rsquo;st a fool of thyself.&nbsp; If so, not
Satan himself could save thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was well that Christina had resolution to prevent her
making a fool of herself on the spot, for the thought of the
pathway turned her so dizzy that she could only shut her eyes,
trusting that her father did not see her terror.&nbsp; Soon the
turn round to the side of the mountain was made, and the road
became a mere track worn out on the turf on the hillside, with an
abyss beneath, close to the edge of which the mule, of course,
walked.</p>
<p>When she ventured to look again, she perceived that the ravine
was like an enormous crack open on the mountain-side, and that
the stream that formed the Debateable Ford flowed down the bottom
of it.&nbsp; The ravine itself went probably all the way up the
mountain, growing shallower as it ascended higher; but here,
where Christina beheld it, it was extremely deep, and savagely
desolate and bare.&nbsp; She now saw that the Eagle&rsquo;s
Ladder was a succession of bare gigantic terraces of rock, of
which the opposite side of the ravine was composed, and on one of
which stood the castle.&nbsp; It was no small mystery to her how
it had ever been built, or how she was ever to get there.&nbsp;
She saw in the opening of the ravine the green meadows and woods
far below; and, when her father pointed out to her the Debateable
Ford, apparently much nearer to the castle than they themselves
were at present, she asked why they had so far overpassed the
castle, and come by this circuitous course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;we are not eagles
outright.&nbsp; Seest thou not, just beyond the castle court,
this whole crag of ours breaks off short, falls like the town
wall straight down into the plain?&nbsp; Even this cleft that we
are crossing by, the only road a horse can pass, breaks off short
and sudden too, so that the river is obliged to take leaps which
nought else but a chamois could compass.&nbsp; A footpath there
is, and Freiherr Eberhard takes it at all times, being born to
it; but even I am too stiff for the like.&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp; Thy
uncle may talk of the Kaiser and his League, but he would change
his note if we had him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet castles have been taken by hunger,&rdquo; said
Christina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, knowest thou so much?&mdash;True!&nbsp; But look
you,&rdquo; pointing to a white foamy thread that descended the
opposite steeps, &ldquo;yonder beck dashes through the castle
court, and it never dries; and see you the ledge the castle
stands on?&nbsp; It winds on out of your sight, and forms a path
which leads to the village of Adlerstein, out on the other slope
of the mountains; and ill were it for the serfs if they
victualled not the castle well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fearful steepness of the ground absorbed all
Christina&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; The road, or rather stairs,
came down to the stream at the bottom of the fissure, and then
went again on the other side up still more tremendous steeps,
which Hugh climbed with a staff, sometimes with his hand on the
bridle, but more often only keeping a watchful eye on the
sure-footed mule, and an arm to steady his daughter in the saddle
when she grew absolutely faint with giddiness at the abyss around
her.&nbsp; She was too much in awe of him to utter cry or
complaint, and, when he saw her effort to subdue her mortal
terror, he was far from unkind, and let her feel his protecting
strength.</p>
<p>Presently a voice was heard above&mdash;&ldquo;What, Sorel,
hast brought her!&nbsp; Trudchen is wearying for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were in the most boorish dialect and pronunciation,
the stranger to Christina&rsquo;s ears, because intercourse with
foreign merchants, and a growing affectation of Latinism, had
much refined the city language to which she was accustomed; and
she was surprised to perceive by her father&rsquo;s gesture and
address that the speaker must be one of the lords of the
castle.&nbsp; She looked up, and saw on the pathway above her a
tall, large-framed young man, his skin dyed red with sun and
wind, in odd contrast with his pale shaggy hair, moustache, and
beard, as though the weather had tanned the one and bleached the
other.&nbsp; His dress was a still shabbier buff suit than her
father had worn, but with a richly-embroidered belt sustaining a
hunting-horn with finely-chased ornaments of tarnished silver,
and an eagle&rsquo;s plume was fastened into his cap with a large
gold Italian coin.&nbsp; He stared hard at the maiden, but
vouchsafed her no token of greeting&mdash;only distressed her
considerably by distracting her father&rsquo;s attention from her
mule by his questions about the journey, all in the same rude,
coarse tone and phraseology.&nbsp; Some amount of illusion was
dispelled.&nbsp; Christina was quite prepared to find the
mountain lords dangerous ruffians, but she had expected the
graces of courtesy and high birth; but, though there was
certainly an air of command and freedom of bearing about the
present specimen, his manners and speech were more uncouth than
those of any newly-caught apprentice of her uncle, and she could
not help thinking that her good aunt Johanna need not have
troubled herself about the danger of her taking a liking to any
such young Freiherr as she here beheld.</p>
<p>By this time a last effort of the mule had climbed to the
level of the castle.&nbsp; As her father had shown her, there was
precipice on two sides of the building; on the third, a sheer
wall of rock going up to a huge height before it reached another
of the Eagle&rsquo;s Steps; and on the fourth, where the gateway
was, the little beck had been made to flow in a deep channel that
had been hollowed out to serve as a moat, before it bounded down
to swell the larger water-course in the ravine.&nbsp; A temporary
bridge had been laid across; the drawbridge was out of order, and
part of Hugh&rsquo;s business had been to procure materials for
mending its apparatus.&nbsp; Christina was told to dismount and
cross on foot.&nbsp; The unrailed board, so close to the abyss,
and with the wild water foaming above and below, was dreadful to
her; and, though she durst not speak, she hung back with an
involuntary shudder, as her father, occupied with the mule, did
not think of giving her a hand.&nbsp; The young baron burst out
into an unrestrained laugh&mdash;a still greater shock to her
feelings; but at the same time he roughly took her hand, and
almost dragged her across, saying, &ldquo;City bred&mdash;ho,
ho!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks, sir,&rdquo; she strove to say,
but she was very near weeping with the terror and strangeness of
all around.</p>
<p>The low-browed gateway, barely high enough to admit a man on
horseback, opened before her, almost to her feelings like the
gate of the grave, and she could not help crossing herself, with
a silent prayer for protection, as she stepped under it, and came
into the castle court&mdash;not such a court as gave its name to
fair courtesy, but, if truth must be told, far more resembling an
ill-kept, ill-savoured stable-yard, with the piggeries opening
into it.&nbsp; In unpleasantly close quarters, the Schneiderlein,
or little tailor, <i>i.e.</i> the biggest and fiercest of all the
knappen, was grooming Nibelung; three long-backed, long-legged,
frightful swine were grubbing in a heap of refuse; four or five
gaunt ferocious-looking dogs came bounding up to greet their
comrade Festhold; and a great old long-bearded goat stood on the
top of the mixen, looking much disposed to butt at any
newcomer.&nbsp; The Sorel family had brought cleanliness from
Flanders, and Hausfrau Johanna was scrupulously dainty in all her
appointments.&nbsp; Christina scarcely knew how she conveyed
herself and her blue kirtle across the bemired stones to the next
and still darker portal, under which a wide but rough ill-hewn
stair ascended.&nbsp; The stables, in fact, occupied the lower
floor of the main building, and not till these stairs had
ascended above them did they lead out into the castle hall.&nbsp;
Here were voices&mdash;voices rude and harsh, like those
Christina had shrunk from in passing drinking booths.&nbsp; There
was a long table, with rough men-at-arms lounging about, and
staring rudely at her; and at the upper end, by a great open
chimney, sat, half-dozing, an elderly man, more rugged in feature
than his son; and yet, when he roused himself and spoke to Hugh,
there was a shade more of breeding, and less of clownishness in
his voice and deportment, as if he had been less entirely devoid
of training.&nbsp; A tall darkly-robed woman stood beside
him&mdash;it was her harsh tone of reproof and command that had
so startled Christina as she entered&mdash;and her huge towering
cap made her look gigantic in the dim light of the smoky
hall.&nbsp; Her features had been handsome, but had become
hardened into a grim wooden aspect; and with sinking spirits
Christina paused at the step of the da&iuml;s, and made her
reverence, wishing she could sink beneath the stones of the
pavement out of sight of these terrible personages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the wench you have taken all this
trouble for,&rdquo; was Freiherrinn Kunigunde&rsquo;s
greeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;She looks like another sick baby to nurse;
but I&rsquo;ll have no trouble about her;&mdash;that is
all.&nbsp; Take her up to Ermentrude; and thou, girl, have a care
thou dost her will, and puttest none of thy city fancies into her
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hark thee, girl,&rdquo; added the old Freiherr,
sitting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;So thou canst nurse her well, thou shalt
have a new gown and a stout husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That way,&rdquo; pointed the lady towards one of the
four corner towers; and Christina moved doubtfully towards it,
reluctant to quit her father, her only protector, and afraid to
introduce herself.&nbsp; The younger Freiherr, however, stepped
before her, went striding two or three steps at a time up the
turret stair, and, before Christina had wound her way up, she
heard a thin, impatient voice say, &ldquo;Thou saidst she was
come, Ebbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even so,&rdquo; she heard Freiherr Eberhard
return; &ldquo;but she is slow and town-bred.&nbsp; She was
afraid of crossing the moat.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then both laughed,
so that Christina&rsquo;s cheeks tingled as she emerged from the
turret into another vaulted room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here she
is,&rdquo; quoth the brother; &ldquo;now will she make thee quite
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very bare and desolate room, with no hangings to the
rough stone walls, and scarcely any furniture, except a great
carved bedstead, one wooden chair, a table, and some
stools.&nbsp; On the bare floor, in front of the fire, her arm
under her head, and a profusion of long hair falling round her
like flax from a distaff, lay wearily a little figure, beside
whom Sir Eberhard was kneeling on one knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is my sisterling,&rdquo; said he, looking up to
the newcomer.&nbsp; &ldquo;They say you burgher women have ways
of healing the sick.&nbsp; Look at her.&nbsp; Think you you can
heal her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an excess of dumb shyness Ermentrude half rose, and
effectually hindered any observations on her looks by hiding her
face away upon her brother&rsquo;s knee.&nbsp; It was the gesture
of a child of five years old, but Ermentrude&rsquo;s length of
limb forbade Christina to suppose her less than fourteen or
fifteen.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, wilt not look at her?&rdquo; he said,
trying to raise her head; and then, holding out one of her
wasted, feverish hands to Christina, he again asked, with a
wistfulness that had a strange effect from the large, tall man,
almost ten years her elder, &ldquo;Canst thou cure her,
maiden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no doctor, sir,&rdquo; replied Christina;
&ldquo;but I could, at least, make her more comfortable.&nbsp;
The stone is too hard for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not go away; I want the fire,&rdquo; murmured
the sick girl, holding out her hands towards it, and
shivering.</p>
<p>Christina quickly took off her own thick cloth mantle, well
lined with dressed lambskins, laid it on the floor, rolled the
collar of it over a small log of wood&mdash;the only substitute
she could see for a pillow&mdash;and showed an inviting couch in
an instant.&nbsp; Ermentrude let her brother lay her down, and
then was covered with the ample fold.&nbsp; She smiled as she
turned up her thin, wasted face, faded into the same whitey-brown
tint as her hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; she said, but
without thanks; and, feeling the soft lambswool: &ldquo;Is that
what you burgher-women wear?&nbsp; Father is to give me a furred
mantle, if only some court dame would pass the Debateable
Ford.&nbsp; But the Schlangenwaldern got the last before ever we
could get down.&nbsp; Jobst was so stupid.&nbsp; He did not give
us warning in time; but he is to be hanged next time if he does
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina&rsquo;s blood curdled as she heard this speech in a
weak little complaining tone, that otherwise put her sadly in
mind of Barbara Schmidt&rsquo;s little sister, who had pined and
wasted to death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind, Trudchen,&rdquo;
answered the brother kindly; &ldquo;meantime I have kept all the
wild catskins for thee, and may be
this&mdash;this&mdash;<i>she</i> could sew them up into a mantle
for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O let me see,&rdquo; cried the young lady eagerly; and
Sir Eberhard, walking off, presently returned with an armful of
the beautiful brindled furs of the mountain cat, reminding
Christina of her aunt&rsquo;s gentle domestic favourite.&nbsp;
Ermentrude sat up, and regarded the placing out of them with
great interest; and thus her brother left her employed, and so
much delighted that she had not flagged, when a great bell
proclaimed that it was the time for the noontide meal, for which
Christina, in spite of all her fears of the company below stairs,
had been constrained by mountain air to look forward with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Ermentrude, she found, meant to go down, but with no notion of
the personal arrangements that Christina had been wont to think a
needful preliminary.&nbsp; With all her hair streaming, down she
went, and was so gladly welcomed by her father that it was plain
that her presence was regarded as an unusual advance towards
recovery, and Christina feared lest he might already be looking
out for the stout husband.&nbsp; She had much to tell him about
the catskin cloak, and then she was seized with eager curiosity
at the sight of Christina&rsquo;s bundles, and especially at her
lute, which she must hear at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;there will be
jangling and jingling enough by and by&mdash;meat now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole establishment were taking their places&mdash;or
rather tumbling into them.&nbsp; A battered, shapeless metal
vessel seemed to represent the salt-cellar, and next to it Hugh
Sorel seated himself, and kept a place for her beside him.&nbsp;
Otherwise she would hardly have had seat or food.&rsquo; She was
now able to survey the inmates of the castle.&nbsp; Besides the
family themselves, there were about a dozen men, all
ruffianly-looking, and of much lower grade than her father, and
three women.&nbsp; One, old Ursel, the wife of Hatto the
forester, was a bent, worn, but not ill-looking woman, with a
motherly face; the younger ones were hard, bold creatures, from
whom Christina felt a shrinking recoil.&nbsp; The meal was
dressed by Ursel and her kitchen boy.&nbsp; From a great
cauldron, goat&rsquo;s flesh and broth together were ladled out
into wooden bowls.&nbsp; That every one provided their own spoon
and knife&mdash;no fork&mdash;was only what Christina was used to
in the most refined society, and she had the implements in a
pouch hanging to her girdle; but she was not prepared for the
unwashed condition of the bowls, nor for being obliged to share
that of her father&mdash;far less for the absence of all blessing
on the meal, and the coarse boisterousness of manners prevailing
thereat.&nbsp; Hungry as she was, she did not find it easy to
take food under these circumstances, and she was relieved when
Ermentrude, overcome by the turmoil, grew giddy, and was carried
upstairs by her father, who laid her down upon her great bed, and
left her to the attendance of Christina.&nbsp; Ursel had
followed, but was petulantly repulsed by her young lady in favour
of the newcomer, and went away grumbling.</p>
<p>Nestled on her bed, Ermentrude insisted on hearing the lute,
and Christina had to creep down to fetch it, with some other of
her goods, in trembling haste, and redoubled disgust at the
aspect of the meal, which looked even more repulsive in this
later stage, and to one who was no longer partaking of it.</p>
<p>Low and softly, with a voice whence she could scarcely banish
tears, and in dread of attracting attention, Christina sung to
the sick girl, who listened with a sort of rude wonder, and
finally was lulled to sleep.&nbsp; Christina ventured to lay down
her instrument and move towards the window, heavily mullioned
with stone, barred with iron, and glazed with thick glass; being
in fact the only glazed window in the castle.&nbsp; To her great
satisfaction it did not look out over the loathsome court, but
over the opening of the ravine.&nbsp; The apartment occupied the
whole floor of the keep; it was stone-paved, but the roof was
boarded, and there was a round turret at each angle.&nbsp; One
contained the staircase, and was that which ran up above the
keep, served as a watch-tower, and supported the Eagle
banner.&nbsp; The other three were empty, and one of these, which
had a strong door, and a long loophole window looking out over
the open country, Christina hoped that she might
appropriate.&nbsp; The turret was immediately over the
perpendicular cliff that descended into the plain.&nbsp; A stone
thrown from the window would have gone straight down, she knew
not where.&nbsp; Close to her ears rushed the descending
waterfall in its leap over the rock side, and her eyes could rest
themselves on the green meadow land below, and the smooth water
of the Debateable Ford; nay&mdash;far, far away beyond retreating
ridges of wood and field&mdash;she thought she could track a
silver line and, guided by it, a something that might be a
city.&nbsp; Her heart leapt towards it, but she was recalled by
Ermentrude&rsquo;s fretfully imperious voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only looking forth from the window, lady,&rdquo;
she said, returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! thou saw&rsquo;st no travellers at the Ford?&rdquo;
cried Ermentrude, starting up with lively interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, lady; I was gazing at the far distance.&nbsp; Know
you if it be indeed Ulm that we see from these
windows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulm?&nbsp; That is where thou comest from?&rdquo; said
Ermentrude languidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My happy home, with my dear uncle and aunt!&nbsp; O, if
I can but see it hence, it will be joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&nbsp; Let me see,&rdquo; said
Ermentrude, rising; but at the window her pale blue eyes gazed
vacantly as if she did not know what she was looking at or
for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! if the steeple of the Dome Kirk were but finished,
I could not mistake it,&rdquo; said Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
beauteous the white spire will look from hence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dome Kirk?&rdquo; repeated Ermentrude; &ldquo;what is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such an entire blank as the poor child&rsquo;s mind seemed to
be was inconceivable to the maiden, who had been bred up in the
busy hum of men, where the constant resort of strange merchants,
the daily interests of a self-governing municipality, and the
numerous festivals, both secular and religious, were an
unconscious education, even without that which had been bestowed
upon her by teachers, as well as by her companionship with her
uncle, and participation in his studies, taste and arts.</p>
<p>Ermentrude von Adlerstein had, on the contrary, not only never
gone beyond the Kohler&rsquo;s hut on the one side, and the
mountain village on the other, but she never seen more of life
than the festival at the wake the hermitage chapel there on
Midsummer-day.&nbsp; The only strangers who ever came to the
castle were disbanded lanzknechts who took service with her
father, or now and then a captive whom he put to ransom.&nbsp;
She knew absolutely nothing of the world, except for a general
belief that Freiherren lived there to do what they chose with
other people, and that the House of Adlerstein was the freest and
noblest in existence.&nbsp; Also there was a very positive hatred
to the house of Schlangenwald, and no less to that of Adlerstein
Wildschloss, for no reason that Christina could discover save
that, being a younger branch of the family, they had submitted to
the Emperor.&nbsp; To destroy either the Graf von Schlangenwald,
or her Wildschloss cousin, was evidently the highest
gratification Ermentrude could conceive; and, for the rest, that
her father and brother should make successful captures at the
Debateable Ford was the more abiding, because more practicable
hope.&nbsp; She had no further ideas, except perhaps to elude her
mother&rsquo;s severity, and to desire her brother&rsquo;s
success in chamois-hunting.&nbsp; The only mental culture she had
ever received was that old Ursel had taught her the Credo, Pater
Noster, and Ave, as correctly as might be expected from a long
course of traditionary repetitions of an incomprehensible
language.&nbsp; And she knew besides a few German rhymes and
jingles, half Christian, half heathen, with a legend or two
which, if the names were Christian, ran grossly wild from all
Christian meaning or morality.&nbsp; As to the amenities, nay,
almost the proprieties, of life, they were less known in that
baronial castle than in any artisan&rsquo;s house at Ulm.&nbsp;
So little had the sick girl figured them to herself, that she did
not even desire any greater means of ease than she
possessed.&nbsp; She moaned and fretted indeed, with aching limbs
and blank weariness, but without the slightest formed desire for
anything to remove her discomfort, except the few ameliorations
she knew, such as sitting on her brother&rsquo;s knee, with her
head on his shoulder, or tasting the mountain berries that he
gathered for her.&nbsp; Any other desire she exerted herself to
frame was for finery to be gained from the spoils of
travellers.</p>
<p>And this was Christina&rsquo;s charge, whom she must look upon
as the least alien spirit in this dreadful castle of
banishment!&nbsp; The young and old lords seemed to her savage
bandits, who frightened her only less than did the proud sinister
expression of the old lady, for she had not even the merit of
showing any tenderness towards the sickly girl, of whom she was
ashamed, and evidently regarded the town-bred attendant as a
contemptible interloper.</p>
<p>Long, long did the maiden weep and pray that night after
Ermentrude had sunk to sleep.&nbsp; She strained her eyes with
home-sick longings to detect lights where she thought Ulm might
be; and, as she thought of her uncle and aunt, the poodle and the
cat round the stove, the maids spinning and the prentices
knitting as her uncle read aloud some grave good book, most
probably the legend of the saint of the day, and contrasted it
with the rude gruff sounds of revelry that found their way up the
turret stairs, she could hardly restrain her sobs from awakening
the young lady whose bed she was to share.&nbsp; She thought
almost with envy of her own patroness, who was cast into the lake
of Bolsena with a millstone about her neck&mdash;a better fate,
thought she, than to live on in such an abode of loathsomeness
and peril.</p>
<p>But then had not St. Christina floated up alive, bearing up
her millstone with her?&nbsp; And had not she been put into a
dungeon full of venomous reptiles who, when they approached her,
had all been changed to harmless doves?&nbsp; Christina had once
asked Father Balthazar how this could be; and had he not replied
that the Church did not teach these miracles as matters of faith,
but that she might there discern in figure how meek Christian
holiness rose above all crushing burthens, and transformed the
rudest natures.&nbsp; This poor maiden-dying, perhaps; and oh!
how unfit to live or die!&mdash;might it be her part to do some
good work by her, and infuse some Christian hope, some godly
fear?&nbsp; Could it be for this that the saints had led her
hither?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FLOTSAM AND JETSAM OF THE DEBATEABLE
FORD</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> in Schloss Adlerstein was
little less intolerable than Christina&rsquo;s imagination had
depicted it.&nbsp; It was entirely devoid of all the graces of
chivalry, and its squalor and coarseness, magnified into
absurdity by haughtiness and violence, were almost
inconceivable.&nbsp; Fortunately for her, the inmates of the
castle resided almost wholly below stairs in the hall and
kitchen, and in some dismal dens in the thickness of their
walls.&nbsp; The height of the keep was intended for dignity and
defence, rather than for habitation; and the upper chamber, with
its great state-bed, where everybody of the house of Adlerstein
was born and died, was not otherwise used, except when
Ermentrude, unable to bear the oppressive confusion below stairs,
had escaped thither for quietness&rsquo; sake.&nbsp; No one else
wished to inhabit it.&nbsp; The chamber above was filled with the
various appliances for the defence of the castle; and no one
would have ever gone up the turret stairs had not a warder been
usually kept on the roof to watch the roads leading to the
Ford.&nbsp; Otherwise the Adlersteiners had all the savage
instinct of herding together in as small a space as possible.</p>
<p>Freiherrin Kunigunde hardly ever mounted to her
daughter&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; All her affection was centred on
the strong and manly son, of whom she was proud, while the sickly
pining girl, who would hardly find a mate of her own rank, and
who had not even dowry enough for a convent, was such a shame and
burthen to her as to be almost a distasteful object.&nbsp; But
perversely, as it seemed to her, the only daughter was the
darling of both father and brother, who were ready to do anything
to gratify the girl&rsquo;s sick fancies, and hailed with delight
her pleasure in her new attendant.&nbsp; Old Ursel was at first
rather envious and contemptuous of the childish, fragile
stranger, but her gentleness disarmed the old <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>woman; and,
when it was plain that the young lady&rsquo;s sufferings were
greatly lessened by tender care, dislike gave way to attachment,
and there was little more murmuring at the menial services that
were needed by the two maidens, even when Ermentrude&rsquo;s
feeble fancies, or Christina&rsquo;s views of dainty propriety,
rendered them more onerous than before.&nbsp; She was even heard
to rejoice that some Christian care and tenderness had at last
reached her poor neglected child.</p>
<p>It was well for Christina that she had such an ally.&nbsp; The
poor child never crept down stairs to the dinner or supper, to
fetch food for Ermentrude, or water for herself, without a
trembling and shrinking of heart and nerves.&nbsp; Her
father&rsquo;s authority guarded her from rude actions, but from
rough tongues he neither could nor would guard her, nor
understand that what to some would have been a compliment seemed
to her an alarming insult; and her chief safeguard lay in her own
insignificance and want of attraction, and still more in the
modesty that concealed her terror at rude jests sufficiently to
prevent frightening her from becoming an entertainment.</p>
<p>Her father, whom she looked on as a cultivated person in
comparison with the rest of the world, did his best for her after
his own views, and gradually brought her all the properties she
had left at the Kohler&rsquo;s hut.&nbsp; Therewith she made a
great difference in the aspect of the chamber, under the full
sanction of the lords of the castle.&nbsp; Wolf, deer, and sheep
skins abounded; and with these, assisted by her father and old
Hatto, she tapestried the lower part of the bare grim walls, a
great bear&rsquo;s hide covered the neighbourhood of the hearth,
and cushions were made of these skins, and stuffed from
Ursel&rsquo;s stores of feathers.&nbsp; All these embellishments
were watched with great delight by Ermentrude, who had never been
made of so much importance, and was as much surprised as relieved
by such attentions.&nbsp; She was too young and too delicate to
reject civilization, and she let Christina braid her hair, bathe
her, and arrange her dress, with sensations of comfort that were
almost like health.&nbsp; To train her into occupying herself was
however, as Christina soon found, in her present state,
impossible.&nbsp; She could spin and sew a little, but hated
both; and her clumsy, listless fingers only soiled and wasted
Christina&rsquo;s needles, silk, and lute strings, and such
damage was not so easily remedied as in the streets of Ulm.&nbsp;
She was best provided for when looking on at her
attendant&rsquo;s busy hands, and asking to be sung to, or to
hear tales of the active, busy scenes of the city life&mdash;the
dresses, fairs, festivals, and guild processions.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The gentle nursing and the new interests made her improve in
health, so that her father was delighted, and Christina began to
hope for a return home.&nbsp; Sometimes the two girls would take
the air, either, on still days, upon the battlements, where
Ermentrude watched the Debateable Ford, and Christina gazed at
the Danube and at Ulm; or they would find their way to a grassy
nook on the mountain-side, where Christina gathered gentians and
saxifrage, trying to teach her young lady that they were worth
looking at, and sighing at the thought of Master
Gottfried&rsquo;s wreath when she met with the asphodel
seed-vessels.&nbsp; Once the quiet mule was brought into
requisition; and, with her brother walking by her, and Sorel and
his daughter in attendance, Ermentrude rode towards the village
of Adlerstein.&nbsp; It was a collection of miserable huts, on a
sheltered slope towards the south, where there was earth enough
to grow some wretched rye and buckwheat, subject to severe toll
from the lord of the soil.&nbsp; Perched on a hollow rock above
the slope was a rude little church, over a cave where a hermit
had once lived and died in such odour of sanctity that, his day
happening to coincide with that of St. John the Baptist, the
Blessed Freidmund had acquired the credit of the lion&rsquo;s
share both of the saint&rsquo;s honours and of the old solstitial
feast of Midsummer.&nbsp; This wake was the one gaiety of the
year, and attracted a fair which was the sole occasion of coming
honestly by anything from the outer world; nor had his cell ever
lacked a professional anchorite.</p>
<p>The Freiherr of his day had been a devout man, who had gone a
pilgrimage with Kaiser Friedrich of the Red Beard, and had
brought home a bit of stone from the council chamber of
Nic&aelig;a, which he had presented to the little church that he
had built over the cavern.&nbsp; He had named his son Friedmund;
and there were dim memories of his days as of a golden age,
before the Wildschlossen had carried off the best of the
property, and when all went well.</p>
<p>This was Christina&rsquo;s first sight of a church since her
arrival, except that in the chapel, which was a dismal neglected
vault, where a ruinous altar and mouldering crucifix testified to
its sacred purpose.&nbsp; The old baron had been excommunicated
for twenty years, ever since he had harried the wains of the
Bishop of Augsburg on his way to the Diet; and, though his
household and family were not under the same sentence,
&ldquo;Sunday didna come abune the pass.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Christina&rsquo;s entreaty obtained permission to enter the
little building, but she had knelt there only a few moments
before her father came to hurry her away, and her supplications
that he would some day take her to mass there were whistled down
the wind; and indeed the hermit was a layman, and the church was
only served on great festivals by a monk from the convent of St.
Ruprecht, on the distant side of the mountain, which was further
supposed to be in the Schlangenwald interest.&nbsp; Her best
chance lay in infusing the desire into Ermentrude, who by
watching her prayers and asking a few questions had begun to
acquire a few clearer ideas.&nbsp; And what Ermentrude wished had
always hitherto been acquiesced in by the two lords.</p>
<p>The elder baron came little into Christina&rsquo;s way.&nbsp;
He meant to be kind to her, but she was dreadfully afraid of him,
and, when he came to visit his daughter, shrank out of his notice
as much as possible, shuddering most of all at his attempts at
civilities.&nbsp; His son she viewed as one of the thickwitted
giants meant to be food for the heroism of good knights of
romance.&nbsp; Except that he was fairly conversant with the use
of weapons, and had occasionally ridden beyond the shadow of his
own mountain, his range was quite as limited as his
sister&rsquo;s; and he had an equal scorn for all beyond
it.&nbsp; His unfailing kindness to his sister was however in his
favour, and he always eagerly followed up any suggestion
Christina made for her pleasure.</p>
<p>Much of his time was spent on the child, whose chief nurse and
playmate he had been throughout her malady; and when she showed
him the stranger&rsquo;s arrangements, or repeated to him, in a
wondering, blundering way, with constant appeals to her
attendant, the new tales she had heard, he used to listen with a
pleased awkward amazement at his little Ermentrude&rsquo;s
astonishing cleverness, joined sometimes with real interest,
which was evinced by his inquiries of Christina.&nbsp; He
certainly did not admire the little, slight, pale bower-maiden,
but he seemed to look upon her like some strange, almost uncanny,
wise spirit out of some other sphere, and his manner towards her
had none of the offensive freedom apparent in even the old
man&rsquo;s patronage.&nbsp; It was, as Ermentrude once said,
laughing, almost as if he feared that she might do something to
him.</p>
<p>Christina had expected to see a ruffian, and had found a boor;
but she was to be convinced that the ruffian existed in
him.&nbsp; Notice came up to the castle of a convoy of waggons,
and all was excitement.&nbsp; Men-at-arms were mustered, horses
led down the Eagle&rsquo;s Ladder, and an ambush prepared in the
woods.&nbsp; The autumn rains were already swelling the floods,
and the passage of the ford would be difficult enough to afford
the assailants an easy prey.</p>
<p>The Freiherrinn Kunigunde herself, and all the women of the
castle, hurried into Ermentrude&rsquo;s room to enjoy the view
from her window.&nbsp; The young lady herself was full of eager
expectation, but she knew enough of her maiden to expect no
sympathy from her, and loved her well enough not to bring down on
her her mother&rsquo;s attention; so Christina crept into her
turret, unable to withdraw her eyes from the sight, trembling,
weeping, praying, longing for power to give a warning
signal.&nbsp; Could they be her own townsmen stopped on the way
to dear Ulm?</p>
<p>She could see the waggons in mid-stream, the warriors on the
bank; she heard the triumphant outcries of the mother and
daughter in the outer room.&nbsp; She saw the overthrow, the
struggle, the flight of a few scattered dark figures on the
farther side, the drawing out of the goods on the nearer.&nbsp;
Oh! were those leaping waves bearing down any good men&rsquo;s
corpses to the Danube, slain, foully slain by her own father and
this gang of robbers?</p>
<p>She was glad that Ermentrude went down with her mother to
watch the return of the victors.&nbsp; She crouched on the floor,
sobbing, shuddering with grief and indignation, and telling her
beads alike for murdered and murderers, till, after the sounds of
welcome and exultation, she heard Sir Eberhard&rsquo;s heavy
tread, as he carried his sister up stairs.&nbsp; Ermentrude went
up at once to Christina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all there was little for us!&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only a wain of wine barrels; and now
will the drunkards down stairs make good cheer.&nbsp; But Ebbo
could only win for me this gold chain and medal which was round
the old merchant&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he slain?&rdquo; Christina asked with pale
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know I did not kill him,&rdquo; returned the
baron; &ldquo;I had him down and got the prize, and that was
enough for me.&nbsp; What the rest of the fellows may have done,
I cannot say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has brought thee something, Stina,&rdquo;
continued Ermentrude.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show it to her,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father sends you this for your care of my
sister,&rdquo; said Eberhard, holding out a brooch that had
doubtless fastened the band of the unfortunate
wine-merchant&rsquo;s bonnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, sir; but, indeed, I may not take it,&rdquo;
said Christina, turning crimson, and drawing back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in amaze; then bethinking
himself,&mdash;&ldquo;They are no townsfolk of yours, but
Constance cowards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it, take it, Stina, or you will anger my
father,&rdquo; added Ermentrude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, lady, I thank the barons both, but it were sin in
me,&rdquo; said Christina, with trembling voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; said Eberhard; &ldquo;we have the full
right&mdash;&rsquo;tis a seignorial right&mdash;to all the goods
of every wayfarer that may be overthrown in our river&mdash;as I
am a true knight!&rdquo; he added earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A true knight!&rdquo; repeated Christina, pushed hard,
and very indignant in all her terror.&nbsp; &ldquo;The true
knight&rsquo;s part is to aid, not rob, the weak.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the dark eyes flashed a vivid light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christina!&rdquo; exclaimed Ermentrude in the extremity
of her amazement, &ldquo;know you what you have said?&mdash;that
Eberhard is no true knight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He meanwhile stood silent, utterly taken by surprise, and
letting his little sister fight his battles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it, Lady Ermentrude,&rdquo; said
Christina, with trembling lips, and eyes filling with
tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may drive me from the castle&mdash;I only
long to be away from it; but I cannot stain my soul by saying
that spoil and rapine are the deeds of a true knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother will beat you,&rdquo; cried Ermentrude,
passionately, ready to fly to the head of the stairs; but her
brother laid his hand upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush, Trudchen; keep thy tongue still, child!&nbsp;
What does it hurt me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he turned on his heels and went down stairs.&nbsp;
Christina crept into her turret, weeping bitterly and with many a
wild thought.&nbsp; Would they visit her offence on her
father?&nbsp; Would they turn them both out together?&nbsp; If
so, would not her father hurl her down the rocks rather than
return her to Ulm?&nbsp; Could she escape?&nbsp; Climb down the
dizzy rocks, it might be, succour the merchant lying half dead on
the meadows, protect and be protected, be once more among
God-fearing Christians?&nbsp; And as she felt her helplessness,
the selfish thoughts passed into a gush of tears for the murdered
man, lying suffering there, and for his possible wife and
children watching for him.&nbsp; Presently Ermentrude peeped
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stina, Stina, don&rsquo;t cry; I will not tell my
mother!&nbsp; Come out, and finish my kerchief!&nbsp; Come
out!&nbsp; No one shall beat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not what I wept for, lady,&rdquo; said
Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not think you would bring harm on
me.&nbsp; But oh!&nbsp; I would I were at home!&nbsp; I grieve
for the bloodshed that I must see and may not hinder, and for
that poor merchant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Ermentrude, &ldquo;you need not fear
for him!&nbsp; I saw his own folk return and lift him up.&nbsp;
But what is he to thee or to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a burgher maid, lady,&rdquo; said Christina,
recovering herself, and aware that it was of little use to bear
testimony to such an auditor as poor little Ermentrude against
the deeds of her own father and brother, which had in reality the
sort of sanction Sir Eberhard had mentioned, much akin to those
coast rights that were the temptation of wreckers.</p>
<p>Still she could not but tremble at the thought of her speech,
and went down to supper in greater trepidation than usual,
dreading that she should be expected to thank the Freiherr for
his gift.&nbsp; But, fortunately, manners were too rare at
Adlerstein for any such omission to be remarkable, and the whole
establishment was in a state of noisy triumph and merriment over
the excellence of the French wine they had captured, so that she
slipped into her seat unobserved.</p>
<p>Every available drinking-horn and cup was full.&nbsp;
Ermentrude was eagerly presented with draughts by both father and
brother, and presently Sir Eberhard exclaimed, turning towards
the shrinking Christina with a rough laugh, &ldquo;Maiden, I trow
thou wilt not taste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina shook her head, and framed a negative with her
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked her father, close to
whom she sat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is&rsquo;t a fast-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause.&nbsp; Many were present who regarded a
fast-day much more than the lives or goods of their
neighbours.&nbsp; Christina again shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said good-natured Sir Eberhard,
evidently wishing to avert any ill consequence from her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis only her loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mirth went on rough and loud, and Christina felt this the
worst of all the miserable meals she had partaken of in fear and
trembling at this place of her captivity.&nbsp; Ermentrude, too,
was soon in such a state of excitement, that not only was
Christina&rsquo;s womanhood bitterly ashamed and grieved for her,
but there was serious danger that she might at any moment break
out with some allusion to her maiden&rsquo;s recusancy in her
reply to Sir Eberhard.</p>
<p>Presently however Ermentrude laid down her head and began to
cry&mdash;violent headache had come on&mdash;and her brother took
her in his arms to carry her up the stairs; but his potations had
begun before hers, and his step was far from steady; he stumbled
more than once on the steps, shook and frightened his sister, and
set her down weeping petulantly.&nbsp; And then came a more
terrible moment; his awe of Christina had passed away; he swore
that she was a lovely maiden, with only too free a tongue, and
that a kiss must be the seal of her pardon.</p>
<p>A house full of intoxicated men, no living creature who would
care to protect her, scarce even her father!&nbsp; But extremity
of terror gave her strength.&nbsp; She spoke
resolutely&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Eberhard, your sister is
ill&mdash;you are in no state to be here.&nbsp; Go down at once,
nor insult a free maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably the low-toned softness of the voice, so utterly
different from the shrill wrangling notes of all the other women
he had known, took him by surprise.&nbsp; He was still sober
enough to be subdued, almost cowed, by resistance of a
description unlike all he had ever seen; his alarm at
Christina&rsquo;s superior power returned in full force, he
staggered to the stairs, Christina rushed after him, closed the
heavy door with all her force, fastened it inside, and would have
sunk down to weep but for Ermentrude&rsquo;s peevish wail of
distress.</p>
<p>Happily Ermentrude was still a child, and, neglected as she
had been, she still had had no one to make her precocious in
matters of this kind.&nbsp; She was quite willing to take
Christina&rsquo;s view of the case, and not resent the exclusion
of her brother; indeed, she was unwell enough to dread the
loudness of his voice and rudeness of his revelry.</p>
<p>So the door remained shut, and Christina&rsquo;s resolve was
taken that she would so keep it while the wine lasted.&nbsp; And,
indeed, Ermentrude had so much fever all that night and the next
day that no going down could be thought of.&nbsp; Nobody came
near the maidens but Ursel, and she described one continued orgie
that made Christina shudder again with fear and disgust.&nbsp;
Those below revelled without interval, except for sleep; and they
took their sleep just where they happened to sink down, then
returned again to the liquor.&nbsp; The old baroness repaired to
the kitchen when the revelry went beyond even her bearing; but
all the time the wine held out, the swine in the court were, as
Ursel averred, better company than the men in the hall.&nbsp; Yet
there might have been worse even than this; for old Ursel
whispered that at the bottom of the stairs there was a
trap-door.&nbsp; Did the maiden know what it covered?&nbsp; It
was an oubliette.&nbsp; There was once a Strasburg armourer who
had refused ransom, and talked of appealing to the Kaiser.&nbsp;
He trod on that door and&mdash;Ursel pointed downwards.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But since that time,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my young lord
has never brought home a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No wonder that all this time Christina cowered at the
discordant sounds below, trembled, and prayed while she waited on
her poor young charge, who tossed and moaned in fever and
suffering.&nbsp; She was still far from recovered when the
materials of the debauch failed, and the household began to
return to its usual state.&nbsp; She was soon restlessly pining
for her brother; and when her father came up to see her, received
him with scant welcome, and entreaties for Ebbo.&nbsp; She knew
she should be better if she might only sit on his knee, and lay
her head on his shoulder.&nbsp; The old Freiherr offered to
accommodate her; but she rejected him petulantly, and still
called for Ebbo, till he went down, promising that her brother
should come.</p>
<p>With a fluttering heart Christina awaited the noble whom she
had perhaps insulted, and whose advances had more certainly
insulted her.&nbsp; Would he visit her with his anger, or return
to that more offensive familiarity?&nbsp; She longed to flee out
of sight, when, after a long interval, his heavy tread was heard;
but she could not even take refuge in her turret, for Ermentrude
was leaning against her.&nbsp; Somehow, the step was less assured
than usual; he absolutely knocked at the door; and, when he came
in, he acknowledged her by a slight inclination of the
head.&nbsp; If she only had known it, this was the first time
that head had ever been bent to any being, human or Divine; but
all she did perceive was that Sir Eberhard was in neither of the
moods she dreaded, only desperately shy and sheepish, and
extremely ashamed, not indeed of his excess, which would have
been, even to a much tamer German baron, only a happy accident,
but of what had passed between himself and her.</p>
<p>He was much grieved to perceive how much ground Ermentrude had
lost, and gave himself up to fondling and comforting her; and in
a few days more, in their common cares for the sister, Christina
lost her newly-acquired horror of the brother, and could not but
be grateful for his forbearance; while she was almost entertained
by the increased awe of herself shown by this huge robber
baron.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SNOW-WREATHS WHEN &rsquo;TIS
THAW</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ermentrude</span> had by no means
recovered the ground she had lost, before the winter set in; and
blinding snow came drifting down day and night, rendering the
whole view, above and below, one expanse of white, only broken by
the peaks of rock which were too steep to sustain the snow.&nbsp;
The waterfall lengthened its icicles daily, and the whole court
was heaped with snow, up even to the top of the high steps to the
hall; and thus, Christina was told, would it continue all the
winter.&nbsp; What had previously seemed to her a strangely
door-like window above the porch now became the only mode of
egress, when the barons went out bear or wolf-hunting, or the
younger took his crossbow and hound to provide the wild-fowl,
which, under Christina&rsquo;s skilful hands, would tempt the
feeble appetite of Ermentrude when she was utterly unable to
touch the salted meats and sausages of the household.</p>
<p>In spite of all endeavours to guard the windows and keep up
the fire, the cold withered the poor child like a fading leaf,
and she needed more and more of tenderness and amusement to
distract her attention from her ailments.&nbsp; Christina&rsquo;s
resources were unfailing.&nbsp; Out of the softer pine and birch
woods provided for the fire, she carved a set of draughtsmen, and
made a board by ruling squares on the end of a settle, and
painting the alternate ones with a compound of oil and
charcoal.&nbsp; Even the old Baron was delighted with this
contrivance, and the pleasure it gave his daughter.&nbsp; He
remembered playing at draughts in that portion of his youth which
had been a shade more polished, and he felt as if the game were
making Ermentrude more hike a lady.&nbsp; Christina was
encouraged to proceed with a set of chessmen, and the shaping of
their characteristic heads under her dexterous fingers was
watched by Ermentrude like something magical.&nbsp; Indeed, the
young lady entertained the belief that there was no limit to her
attendant&rsquo;s knowledge or capacity.</p>
<p>Truly there was a greater brightness and clearness beginning
to dawn even upon poor little Ermentrude&rsquo;s own dull
mind.&nbsp; She took more interest in everything: songs were not
solely lullabies, but she cared to talk them over; tales to which
she would once have been incapable of paying attention were
eagerly sought after; and, above all, the spiritual vacancy that
her mind had hitherto presented was beginning to be filled
up.&nbsp; Christina had brought her own books&mdash;a library of
extraordinary extent for a maiden of the fifteenth century, but
which she owed to her uncle&rsquo;s connexion with the arts of
wood-cutting and printing.&nbsp; A Vulgate from Dr.
Faustus&rsquo;s own press, a mass book and breviary, Thomas
&agrave; Kempis&rsquo;s <i>Imitation</i> and the <i>Nuremburg
Chronicle</i> all in Latin, and the poetry of the gentle
Minnesinger and bird lover, Walther von Vogelweide, in the
vernacular: these were her stock, which Hausfrau Johanna had
viewed as a foolish encumbrance, and Hugh Sorel would never have
transported to the castle unless they had been so well concealed
in Christina&rsquo;s kirtles that he had taken them for parts of
her wardrobe.</p>
<p>Most precious were they now, when, out of the reach of all
teaching save her own, she had to infuse into the sinking
girl&rsquo;s mind the great mysteries of life and death, that so
she might not leave the world without more hope or faith than her
heathen forefathers.&nbsp; For that Ermentrude would live
Christina had never hoped, since that fleeting improvement had
been cut short by the fever of the wine-cup; the look, voice, and
tone had become so completely the same as those of Regina
Grundt&rsquo;s little sister who had pined and died.&nbsp; She
knew she could not cure, but she could, she felt she could,
comfort, cheer, and soften, and she no longer repined at her
enforced sojourn at Adlerstein.&nbsp; She heartily loved her
charge, and could not bear to think how desolate Ermentrude would
be without her.&nbsp; And now the poor girl had become responsive
to her care.&nbsp; She was infinitely softened in manner, and
treated her parents with forms of respect new to them; she had
learnt even to thank old Ursel, dropped her imperious tone, and
struggled with her petulance; and, towards her brother, the
domineering, uncouth adherence was becoming real, tender
affection; while the dependent, reverent love she bestowed upon
Christina was touching and endearing in the extreme.</p>
<p>Freiherr von Adlerstein saw the change, and congratulated
himself on the effect of having a town-bred bower woman; nay,
spoke of the advantage it would be to his daughter, if he could
persuade himself to make the submission to the Kaiser which the
late improvements decided on at the Diet were rendering more and
more inevitable.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> how happy would be the winner
of his gentle Ermentrude!</p>
<p>Freiherrinn von Adlerstein thought the alteration the mere
change from child to woman, and felt insulted by the supposition
that any one might not have been proud to match with a daughter
of Adlerstein, be she what she might.&nbsp; As to submission to
the Kaiser, that was mere folly and weakness&mdash;kaisers,
kings, dukes, and counts had broken their teeth against the rock
of Adlerstein before now!&nbsp; What had come over her husband
and her son to make them cravens?</p>
<p>For Freiherr Eberhard was more strongly convinced than was his
father of the untenableness of their present position.&nbsp; Hugh
Sorel&rsquo;s reports of what he heard at Ulm had shown that the
league that had been discussed at Regensburg was far more
formidable than anything that had ever previously threatened
Schloss Adlerstein, and that if the Graf von Schlangenwald joined
in the coalition, there would be private malice to direct its
efforts against the Adlerstein family.&nbsp; Feud-letters or
challenges had been made unlawful for ten years, and was not
Adlerstein at feud with the world?</p>
<p>Nor did Eberhard look on the submission with the sullen rage
and grief that his father felt in bringing himself to such a
declension from the pride of his ancestors.&nbsp; What the young
Baron heard up stairs was awakening in him a sense of the
poorness and narrowness of his present life.&nbsp; Ermentrude
never spared him what interested her; and, partly from her lips,
partly through her appeals to her attendant, he had learnt that
life had better things to offer than independence on these bare
rocks, and that homage might open the way to higher and worthier
exploits than preying upon overturned waggons.</p>
<p>Dietrich of Berne and his two ancestors, whose lengthy legend
Christina could sing in a low, soft recitative, were revelations
to him of what she meant by a true knight&mdash;the lion in war,
the lamb in peace; the quaint oft-repeated portraits, and still
quainter cities, of the Chronicle, with her explanations and
translations, opened his mind to aspirations for intercourse with
his fellows, for an honourable name, and for esteem in its degree
such as was paid to Sir Parzival, to Karl the Great, or to Rodolf
of Hapsburgh, once a mountain lord like himself.&nbsp; Nay, as
Ermentrude said, stroking his cheek, and smoothing the flaxen
beard, that somehow had become much less rough and tangled than
it used to be, &ldquo;Some day wilt thou be another Good Freiherr
Eberhard, whom all the country-side loved, and who gave bread at
the castle-gate to all that hungered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother believed nothing of her slow declension in
strength, ascribing all the change he saw to the bitter cold, and
seeing but little even of that alteration, though he spent many
hours in her room, holding her in his arms, amusing her, or
talking to her and to Christina.&nbsp; All Christina&rsquo;s fear
of him was gone.&nbsp; As long as there was no liquor in the
house, and he was his true self, she felt him to be a kind
friend, bound to her by strong sympathy in the love and care for
his sister.&nbsp; She could talk almost as freely before him as
when alone with her young lady; and as Ermentrude&rsquo;s
religious feelings grew stronger, and were freely expressed to
him, surely his attention was not merely kindness and patience
with the sufferer.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s soul ripened rapidly under the new influences
during her bodily decay; and, as the days lengthened, and the
stern hold of winter relaxed upon the mountains, Christina looked
with strange admiration upon the expression that had dawned upon
the features once so vacant and dull, and listened with the more
depth of reverence to the sweet words of faith, hope and love,
because she felt that a higher, deeper teaching than she could
give must have come to mould the spirit for the new world to
which it was hastening.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like an army defeated,<br />
The snow had retreated,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>out of the valley, whose rich green shone smiling round the
pool into which the Debateable Ford spread.&nbsp; The waterfall
had burst its icy bonds, and dashed down with redoubled voice,
roaring rather than babbling.&nbsp; Blue and pink
hepaticas&mdash;or, as Christina called them,
liver-krauts&mdash;had pushed up their starry heads, and had even
been gathered by Sir Eberhard, and laid on his sister&rsquo;s
pillow.&nbsp; The dark peaks of rock came out all glistening with
moisture, and the snow only retained possession of the deep
hollows and crevices, into which however its retreat was far more
graceful than when, in the city, it was trodden by horse and man,
and soiled with smoke.</p>
<p>Christina dreaded indeed that the roads should be open, but
she could not love the snow; it spoke to her of dreariness,
savagery, and captivity, and she watched the dwindling stripes
with satisfaction, and hailed the fall of the petty avalanches
from one Eagle&rsquo;s Step to another as her forefathers might
have rejoiced in the defeat of the Frost giants.</p>
<p>But Ermentrude had a love for the white sheet that lay
covering a gorge running up from the ravine.&nbsp; She watched
its diminution day by day with a fancy that she was melting away
with it; and indeed it was on the very day that a succession of
drifting showers had left the sheet alone, and separated it from
the masses of white above, that it first fully dawned upon the
rest of the family that, for the little daughter of the house,
spring was only bringing languor and sinking instead of
recovery.</p>
<p>Then it was that Sir Eberhard first really listened to her
entreaty that she might not die without a priest, and comforted
her by passing his word to her that, if&mdash;he would not say
when&mdash;the time drew near, he would bring her one of the
priests who had only come from St. Ruprecht&rsquo;s cloister on
great days, by a sort of sufferance, to say mass at the Blessed
Friedmund&rsquo;s hermitage chapel.</p>
<p>The time was slow in coming.&nbsp; Easter had passed with
Ermentrude far too ill for Christina to make the effort she had
intended of going to the church, even if she could get no escort
but old Ursel&mdash;the sheet of snow had dwindled to a mere
wreath&mdash;the ford looked blue in the sunshine&mdash;the
cascade tinkled merrily down its rock&mdash;mountain primroses
peeped out, when, as Father Norbert came forth from saying his
ill-attended Pentecostal mass, and was parting with the infirm
peasant hermit, a tall figure strode up the pass, and, as the
villagers fell back to make way, stood before the startled
priest, and said, in a voice choked with grief, &ldquo;Come with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who needs me?&rdquo; began the astonished monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow him not, father!&rdquo; whispered the
hermit.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the young Freiherr.&mdash;Oh have
mercy on him, gracious sir; he has done your noble lordships no
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean him no ill,&rdquo; replied Eberhard, clearing
his voice with difficulty; &ldquo;I would but have him do his
office.&nbsp; Art thou afraid, priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who needs my office?&rdquo; demanded Father
Norbert.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show me fit cause, and what should I
dread?&nbsp; Wherefore dost thou seek me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my sister,&rdquo; replied Eberhard, his voice
thickening again.&nbsp; &ldquo;My little sister lies at the point
of death, and I have sworn to her that a priest she shall
have.&nbsp; Wilt thou come, or shall I drag thee down the
pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come, I come with all my heart, sir knight,&rdquo;
was the ready response.&nbsp; &ldquo;A few moments and I am at
your bidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped back into the hermit&rsquo;s cave, whence a stair
led up to the chapel.&nbsp; The anchorite followed him,
whispering&mdash;&ldquo;Good father, escape!&nbsp; There will be
full time ere he misses you.&nbsp; The north door leads to the
Gemsbock&rsquo;s Pass; it is open now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I baulk him?&nbsp; Why should I deny my
office to the dying?&rdquo; said Norbert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! holy father, thou art new to this country, and
know&rsquo;st not these men of blood!&nbsp; It is a snare to make
the convent ransom thee, if not worse.&nbsp; The Freiherrinn is a
fiend for malice, and the Freiherr is excommunicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, my son,&rdquo; said Norbert; &ldquo;but
wherefore should their child perish unassoilzied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art coming, priest?&rdquo; shouted Eberhard, from his
stand at the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>And, as Norbert at once appeared with the pyx and other
appliances that he had gone to fetch, the Freiherr held out his
hand with an offer to &ldquo;carry his gear for him;&rdquo; and,
when the monk refused, with an inward shudder at entrusting a
sacred charge to such unhallowed hands, replied, &ldquo;You will
have work enow for both hands ere the castle is
reached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Father Norbert was by birth a sturdy Switzer, and thought
little of these Swabian Alps; and he climbed after his guide
through the most rugged passages of Eberhard&rsquo;s shortest and
most perpendicular cut without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and
with agility worthy of a chamois.&nbsp; The young baron turned
for a moment, when the level of the castle had been gained,
perhaps to see whether he were following, but at the same time
came to a sudden, speechless pause.</p>
<p>On the white masses of vapour that floated on the opposite
side of the mountain was traced a gigantic shadowy outline of a
hermit, with head bent eagerly forward, and arm outstretched.</p>
<p>The monk crossed himself.&nbsp; Eberhard stood still for a
moment, and then said, hoarsely,&mdash;&ldquo;The Blessed
Friedmund!&nbsp; He is come for her;&rdquo; then strode on
towards the postern gate, followed by Brother Norbert, a good
deal reassured both as to the genuineness of the young
Baron&rsquo;s message and the probable condition of the object of
his journey, since the patron saint of her race was evidently on
the watch to speed her departing spirit.</p>
<p>Sir Eberhard led the way up the turret stairs to the open
door, and the monk entered the death-chamber.&nbsp; The elder
Baron sat near the fire in the large wooden chair, half turned
towards his daughter, as one who must needs be present, but with
his face buried in his hands, unable to endure the
spectacle.&nbsp; Nearer was the tall form of his wife, standing
near the foot of the bed, her stern, harsh features somewhat
softened by the feelings of the moment.&nbsp; Ursel waited at
hand, with tears running down her furrowed cheeks.</p>
<p>For such as these Father Norbert was prepared; but he little
expected to meet so pure and sweet a gaze of reverential welcome
as beamed on him from the soft, dark eyes of the little
white-checked maiden who sat on the bed, holding the sufferer in
her arms.&nbsp; Still less had he anticipated the serene
blessedness that sat on the wasted features of the dying girl,
and all the anguish of labouring breath.</p>
<p>She smiled a smile of joy, held up her hand, and thanked her
brother.&nbsp; Her father scarcely lifted his head, her mother
made a rigid curtsey, and with a grim look of sorrow coming over
her features, laid her hand over the old Baron&rsquo;s
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come away, Herr Vater,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;he is going to hear her confession, and make her too holy
for the like of us to touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man rose up, and stepped towards his child.&nbsp;
Ermentrude held out her arms to him, and murmured&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, father, pardon me; I would have been a better
daughter if I had only known&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He gathered her
in his arms; he was quite past speaking; and they only heard his
heavy breathing, and one more whisper from
Ermentrude&mdash;&ldquo;And oh! father, one day wilt thou seek to
be absolved?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether he answered or not they knew
not; he only gave her repeated kisses, and laid her down on her
pillows, then rushed to the door, and the passionate sobs of the
strong man&rsquo;s uncontrolled nature might be heard upon the
stair.&nbsp; The parting with the others was not necessarily so
complete, as they were not, like him, under censure of the
Church; but Kunigunde leant down to kiss her; and, in return to
her repetition of her entreaty for pardon, replied, &ldquo;Thou
hast it, child, if it will ease thy mind; but it is all along of
these new fancies that ever an Adlerstein thought of
pardon.&nbsp; There, there, I blame thee not, poor maid; it thou
wert to die, it may be even best as it is.&nbsp; Now must I to
thy father; he is troubled enough about this gear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Eberhard moved towards his sister, she turned to the
priest, and said, imploringly, &ldquo;Not far, not far!&nbsp; Oh!
let them,&rdquo; pointing to Eberhard and Christina, &ldquo;let
them not be quite out of sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of hearing is all that is needed, daughter,&rdquo;
replied the priest; and Ermentrude looked content as Christina
moved towards the empty north turret, where, with the door open,
she was in full view, and Eberhard followed her thither.&nbsp; It
was indeed fully out of earshot of the child&rsquo;s faint,
gasping confession.&nbsp; Gravely and sadly both stood
there.&nbsp; Christina looked up the hillside for the
snow-wreath.&nbsp; The May sunshine had dissolved it; the green
pass lay sparkling without a vestige of its white coating.&nbsp;
Her eyes full of tears, she pointed the spot out to
Eberhard.&nbsp; He understood; but, leaning towards her, told,
under his breath, of the phantom he had seen.&nbsp; Her eyes
expanded with awe of the supernatural.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the
Blessed Friedmund,&rdquo; said Eberhard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never hath
he so greeted one of our race since the pious Freiherrinn
Hildegarde.&nbsp; Maiden, hast thou brought us back a
blessing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! well may she be blessed&mdash;well may the saints
stoop to greet her,&rdquo; murmured Christina, with strangled
voice, scarcely able to control her sobs.</p>
<p>Father Norbert came towards them.&nbsp; The simple confession
had been heard, and he sought the aid of Christina in performing
the last rites of the Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maiden,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;thou hast done a
great and blessed work, such as many a priest might envy
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eberhard was not excluded during the final services by which
the soul was to be dismissed from its earthly
dwelling-place.&nbsp; True, he comprehended little of their
import, and nothing of the words, but he gazed meekly, with
uncovered head, and a bewildered look of sadness, while Christina
made her responses and took her part with full intelligence and
deep fervour, sorrowing indeed for the companion who had become
so dear to her, but deeply thankful for the spiritual consolation
that had come at last.&nbsp; Ermentrude lay calm, and, as it
were, already rapt into a higher world, lighting up at the German
portions of the service, and not wholly devoid of comprehension
of the spirit even of the Latin, as indeed she had come to the
border of the region where human tongues and languages are no
more.</p>
<p>She was all but gone when the rite of extreme unction was
completed, and they could only stand round her, Eberhard,
Christina, Ursel, and the old Baroness, who had returned again,
watching the last flutterings of the breath, the window thrown
wide open that nothing might impede the passage of the soul to
the blue vault above.</p>
<p>The priest spoke the beautiful commendation, &ldquo;Depart, O
Christian soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a faint gesture in the
midst for Christina to lift her in her arms&mdash;a sign to bend
down and kiss her brow&mdash;but her last look was for her
brother, her last murmur, &ldquo;Come after me; be the Good Baron
Ebbo.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE YOUNG FREIHERR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ermentrude von Adlerstein</span> slept
with her forefathers in the vaults of the hermitage chapel, and
Christina Sorel&rsquo;s work was done.</p>
<p>Surely it was time for her to return home, though she should
be more sorry to leave the mountain castle than she could ever
have believed possible.&nbsp; She entreated her father to take
her home, but she received a sharp answer that she did not know
what she was talking of: the Schlangenwald Reitern were besetting
all the roads; and moreover the Ulm burghers had taken the
capture of the Constance wine in such dudgeon that for a retainer
of Adlerstein to show himself in the streets would be an absolute
asking for the wheel.</p>
<p>But was there any hope for her?&nbsp; Could he not take her to
some nunnery midway, and let her write to her uncle to fetch her
from thence?</p>
<p>He swore at woman&rsquo;s pertinacity, but allowed at last
that if the plan, talked of by the Barons, of going to make their
submission to the Emperor at Linz, with a view to which all
violence at the ford had ceased, should hold good, it might be
possible thus to drop her on their way.</p>
<p>With this Christina must needs content herself.&nbsp; Poor
child, not only had Ermentrude&rsquo;s death deprived her of the
sole object of her residence at Schloss Adlerstein, but it had
infinitely increased the difficulties of her position.&nbsp; No
one interfered with her possession of the upper room and its
turrets; and it was only at meal times that she was obliged to
mingle with the other inhabitants, who, for the most part,
absolutely overlooked the little shrinking pale maiden but with
one exception, and that the most perplexing of all.&nbsp; She had
been on terms with Freiherr Eberhard that were not so easily
broken off as if she had been an old woman of Ursel&rsquo;s
age.&nbsp; All through his sister&rsquo;s decline she had been
his comforter, assistant, director, living in intercourse and
sympathy that ought surely to cease when she was no longer his
sister&rsquo;s attendant, yet which must be more than ever missed
in the full freshness of the stroke.</p>
<p>Even on the earliest day of bereavement, a sudden thought of
Hausfrau Johanna flashed upon Christina, and reminded her of the
guard she must keep over herself if she would return to Ulm the
same modest girl whom her aunt could acquit of all
indiscretion.&nbsp; Her cheeks flamed, as she sat alone, with the
very thought, and the next time she heard the well-known tread on
the stair, she fled hastily into her own turret chamber, and shut
the door.&nbsp; Her heart beat fast.&nbsp; She could hear Sir
Eberhard moving about the room, and listened to his heavy sigh as
he threw himself into the large chair.&nbsp; Presently he called
her by name, and she felt it needful to open her door and answer,
respectfully,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would I?&nbsp; A little peace, and heed to her who
is gone.&nbsp; To see my father and mother one would think that a
partridge had but flown away.&nbsp; I have seen my father more
sorrowful when his dog had fallen over the abyss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayhap there is more sorrow for a brute that cannot
live again,&rdquo; said Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our bird has her
nest by an Altar that is lovelier and brighter than even our Dome
Kirk will ever be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Christina,&rdquo; he said, dragging a chair
nearer the hearth.&nbsp; &ldquo;My heart is sore, and I cannot
bear the din below.&nbsp; Tell me where my bird is
flown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir; pardon me.&nbsp; I must to the kitchen,&rdquo;
said Christina, crossing her hands over her breast, to still her
trembling heart, for she was very sorry for his grief, but moving
resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must?&nbsp; And wherefore?&nbsp; Thou hast nought to do
there; speak truth!&nbsp; Why not stay with me?&rdquo; and his
great light eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A burgher maid may not sit down with a noble
baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil!&nbsp; Has my mother been plaguing thee,
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; said Christina, &ldquo;she reeks
not of me; but&rdquo;&mdash;steadying her voice with great
difficulty&mdash;&ldquo;it behoves me the more to be
discreet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would not have me come here!&rdquo; he said,
with a wistful tone of reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no power to forbid you; but if you do, I must
betake me to Ursel in the kitchen,&rdquo; said Christina, very
low, trembling and half choked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the rude wenches there!&rdquo; he cried, starting
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, nay, that shall not be!&nbsp; Rather will I
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is very cruel of thee, maiden,&rdquo; he
added, lingering, &ldquo;when I give thee my knightly word that
all should be as when she whom we both loved was here,&rdquo; and
his voice shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could not so be, my lord,&rdquo; returned Christina
with drooping, blushing face; &ldquo;it would not be maidenly in
me.&nbsp; Oh, my lord, you are kind and generous, make it not
hard for me to do what other maidens less lonely have friends to
do for them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind and generous?&rdquo; said Eberhard, leaning over
the back of the chair as if trying to begin a fresh score.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This from you, who told me once I was no true
knight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall call you a true knight with all my
heart,&rdquo; cried Christina, the tears rushing into her eyes,
&ldquo;if you will respect my weakness and loneliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up again, as if to move away; then paused, and,
twisting his gold chain, said, &ldquo;And how am I ever to be
what the happy one bade me, if you will not show me
how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My error would never show you the right,&rdquo; said
Christina, with a strong effort at firmness, and retreating at
once through the door of the staircase, whence she made her way
to the kitchen, and with great difficulty found an excuse for her
presence there.</p>
<p>It had been a hard struggle with her compassion and gratitude,
and, poor little Christina felt with dismay, with something more
than these.&nbsp; Else why was it that, even while principle and
better sense summoned her back to Ulm, she experienced a deadly
weariness of the city-pent air, of the grave, heavy roll of the
river, nay, even of the quiet, well-regulated household?&nbsp;
Why did such a marriage as she had thought her natural destiny,
with some worthy, kind-hearted brother of the guild, become so
hateful to her that she could only aspire to a convent
life?&nbsp; This same burgomaster would be an estimable man, no
doubt, and those around her were ruffians, but she felt utterly
contemptuous and impatient of him.&nbsp; And why was the
interchange of greetings, the few words at meals, worth all the
rest of the day besides to her?&nbsp; Her own heart was the
traitor, and to her own sensations the poor little thing had, in
spirit at least, transgressed all Aunt Johanna&rsquo;s precepts
against young Barons.&nbsp; She wept apart, and resolved, and
prayed, cruelly ashamed of every start of joy or pain that the
sight of Eberhard cost her.&nbsp; From almost the first he had
sat next her at the single table that accommodated the whole
household at meals, and the custom continued, though on some days
he treated her with sullen silence, which she blamed herself for
not rejoicing in, sometimes he spoke a few friendly words; but he
observed, better than she could have dared to expect, her test of
his true knighthood, and never again forced himself into her
apartment, though now and then he came to the door with flowers,
with mountain strawberries, and once with two young doves.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take them, Christina,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are very
like yourself;&rdquo; and he always delayed so long that she was
forced to be resolute, and shut the door on him at last.</p>
<p>Once, when there was to be a mass at the chapel, Hugh Sorel,
between a smile and a growl, informed his daughter that he would
take her thereto.&nbsp; She gladly prepared, and, bent on making
herself agreeable to her father, did not once press on him the
necessity of her return to Ulm.&nbsp; To her amazement and
pleasure, the young Baron was at church, and when on the way
home, he walked beside her mule, she could see no need of sending
him away.</p>
<p>He had been in no school of the conventionalities of life,
and, when he saw that Hugh Sorel&rsquo;s presence had obtained
him this favour, he wistfully asked, &ldquo;Christina, if I bring
your father with me, will you not let me in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entreat me not, my lord,&rdquo; she answered, with
fluttering breath.</p>
<p>She felt the more that she was right in this decision, when
she encountered her father&rsquo;s broad grin of surprise and
diversion, at seeing the young Baron help her to dismount.&nbsp;
It was a look of receiving an idea both new, comical, and
flattering, but by no means the look of a father who would resent
the indignity of attentions to his daughter from a man whose rank
formed an insuperable barrier to marriage.</p>
<p>The effect was a new, urgent, and most piteous entreaty, that
he would find means of sending her home.&nbsp; It brought upon
her the hearing put into words what her own feelings had long
shrunk from confessing to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Why, what now?&nbsp; What, is the young Baron
after thee?&nbsp; Ha! ha! petticoats are few enough up here, but
he must have been ill off ere he took to a little ghost like
thee!&nbsp; I saw he was moping and doleful, but I thought it was
all for his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it is, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me that, when he watches every turn of that dark
eye of thine&mdash;the only good thing thou took&rsquo;st of
mine!&nbsp; Thou art a witch, Stina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, oh hush, for pity&rsquo;s sake, father, and let
me go home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, thou likest him not?&nbsp; Thy mind is all for
the mincing goldsmith opposite, as I ever told thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mind is&mdash;is to return to my uncle and aunt the
true-hearted maiden they parted with,&rdquo; said Christina, with
clasped hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;And oh, father, as you were the son
of a true and faithful mother, be a father to me now!&nbsp; Jeer
not your motherless child, but protect her and help
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh Sorel was touched by this appeal, and he likewise
recollected how much it was for his own interest that his brother
should be satisfied with the care he took of his daughter.&nbsp;
He became convinced that the sooner she was out of the castle the
better, and at length bethought him that, among the merchants who
frequented the Midsummer Fair at the Blessed Friedmund&rsquo;s
Wake, a safe escort might be found to convey her back to Ulm.</p>
<p>If the truth were known, Hugh Sorel was not devoid of a
certain feeling akin to contempt, both for his young
master&rsquo;s taste, and for his forbearance in not having
pushed matters further with a being so helpless, meek, and timid
as Christina, more especially as such slackness had not been his
wont in other cases where his fancy had been caught.</p>
<p>But Sorel did not understand that it was not physical beauty
that here had been the attraction, though to some persons, the
sweet, pensive eyes, the delicate, pure skin, the slight, tender
form, might seem to exceed in loveliness the fully developed
animal comeliness chiefly esteemed at Adlerstein.&nbsp; It was
rather the strangeness of the power and purity of this timid,
fragile creature, that had struck the young noble.&nbsp; With all
their brutal manners reverence for a lofty female nature had been
in the German character ever since their Velleda prophesied to
them, and this reverence in Eberhard bowed at the feet of the
pure gentle maiden, so strong yet so weak, so wistful and
entreating even in her resolution, refined as a white flower on a
heap of refuse, wise and dexterous beyond his slow and dull
conception, and the first being in whom he had ever seen piety or
goodness; and likewise with a tender, loving spirit of
consolation such as he had both beheld and tasted by his
sister&rsquo;s deathbed.</p>
<p>There was almost a fear mingled with his reverence.&nbsp; If
he had been more familiar with the saints, he would thus have
regarded the holy virgin martyrs, nay, even Our Lady herself; and
he durst not push her so hard as to offend her, and excite the
anger or the grief that he alike dreaded.&nbsp; He was wretched
and forlorn without the resources he had found in his
sister&rsquo;s room; the new and better cravings of his higher
nature had been excited only to remain unsupplied and
disappointed; and the affectionate heart in the freshness of its
sorrow yearned for the comfort that such conversation had
supplied: but the impression that had been made on him was still
such, that he knew that to use rough means of pressing his wishes
would no more lead to his real gratification than it would to
appropriate a snow-bell by crushing it in his gauntlet.</p>
<p>And it was on feeble little Christina, yielding in heart,
though not in will, that it depended to preserve this reverence,
and return unscathed from this castle, more perilous now than
ever.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BLESSED FRIEDMUND&rsquo;S
WAKE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Midsummer-Day</span> arrived, and the
village of Adlerstein presented a most unusual spectacle.&nbsp;
The wake was the occasion of a grand fair for all the
mountain-side, and it was an understood thing that the Barons,
instead of molesting the pedlars, merchants, and others who
attended it, contented themselves with demanding a toll from
every one who passed the Kohler&rsquo;s hut on the one side, or
the Gemsbock&rsquo;s Pass on the other; and this toll, being the
only coin by which they came honestly in the course of the year,
was regarded as a certainty and highly valued.&nbsp; Moreover, it
was the only time that any purchases could be made, and the
flotsam of the ford did not always include all even of the few
requirements of the inmates of the castle; it was the only
holiday, sacred or secular, that ever gladdened the Eagle&rsquo;s
Rock.</p>
<p>So all the inmates of the castle prepared to enjoy themselves,
except the heads of the house.&nbsp; The Freiherr had never been
at one of these wakes since the first after he was
excommunicated, when he had stalked round to show his
indifference to the sentence; and the Freiherrinn snarled out
such sentences of disdain towards the concourse, that it might be
supposed that she hated the sight of her kind; but Ursel had all
the household purchases to make, and the kitchen underlings were
to take turns to go and come, as indeed were the men-at-arms, who
were set to watch the toll-bars.</p>
<p>Christina had packed up a small bundle, for the chance of
being unable to return to the castle without missing her escort,
though she hoped that the fair might last two days, and that she
should thus be enabled to return and bring away the rest of her
property.&nbsp; She was more and more resolved on going, but her
heart was less and less inclined to departure.&nbsp; And bitter
had been her weeping through all the early light hours of the
long morning&mdash;weeping that she tried to think was all for
Ermentrude; and all, amid prayers she could scarce trust herself
to offer, that the generous, kindly nature might yet work free of
these evil surroundings, and fulfil the sister&rsquo;s dying
wish, she should never see it; but, when she should hear that the
Debateable Ford was the Friendly Ford, then would she know that
it was the doing of the Good Baron Ebbo.&nbsp; Could she venture
on telling him so?&nbsp; Or were it not better that there were no
farewell?&nbsp; And she wept again that he should think her
ungrateful.&nbsp; She could not persuade herself to release the
doves, but committed the charge to Ursel to let them go in case
she should not return.</p>
<p>So tear-stained was her face, that, ashamed that it should be
seen, she wrapped it closely in her hood and veil when she came
down and joined her father.&nbsp; The whole scene swam in tears
before her eyes when she saw the whole green slope from the
chapel covered with tents and booths, and swarming with pedlars
and mountaineers in their picturesque dresses.&nbsp; Women and
girls were exchanging the yarn of their winter&rsquo;s spinning
for bright handkerchiefs; men drove sheep, goats, or pigs to
barter for knives, spades, or weapons; others were gazing at
simple shows&mdash;a dancing bear or ape&mdash;or clustering
round a Minnesinger; many even then congregating in booths for
the sale of beer.&nbsp; Further up, on the flat space of sward
above the chapel, were some lay brothers, arranging for the
representation of a mystery&mdash;a kind of entertainment which
Germany owed to the English who came to the Council of Constance,
and which the monks of St. Ruprecht&rsquo;s hoped might infuse
some religious notions into the wild, ignorant mountaineers.</p>
<p>First however Christina gladly entered the church.&nbsp;
Crowded though it were, it was calmer than the busy scene
without.&nbsp; Faded old tapestry was decking its walls,
representing apparently some subject entirely alien to St. John
or the blessed hermit; Christina rather thought it was Mars and
Venus, but that was all the same to every one else.&nbsp; And
there was a terrible figure of St. John, painted life-like, with
a real hair-cloth round his loins, just opposite to her, on the
step of the Altar; also poor Friedmund&rsquo;s bones, dressed up
in a new serge amice and hood; the stone from Nic&aelig;a was in
a gilded box, ready in due time to be kissed; and a preaching
friar (not one of the monks of St. Ruprecht&rsquo;s) was in the
midst of a sermon, telling how St. John presided at the Council
of Nic&aelig;a till the Emperor Maximius cut off his head at the
instance of Herodius&mdash;full justice being done to the
dancing&mdash;and that the blood was sprinkled on this very
stone, whereupon our Holy Father the Pope decreed that whoever
would kiss the said stone, and repeat the Credo five times
afterwards, should be capable of receiving an indulgence for 500
years: which indulgence must however be purchased at the rate of
six groschen, to be bestowed in alms at Rome.&nbsp; And this
inestimable benefit he, poor Friar Peter, had come from his
brotherhood of St. Francis at Offingen solely to dispense to the
poor mountaineers.</p>
<p>It was disappointing to find this profane mummery going on
instead of the holy services to which Christina had looked
forward for strength and comfort; she was far too well instructed
not to be scandalized at the profane deception which was ripening
fast for Luther, only thirty years later; and, when the stone was
held up by the friar in one hand, the printed briefs of
indulgence in the other, she shrunk back.&nbsp; Her father
however said, &ldquo;Wilt have one, child?&nbsp; Five hundred
years is no bad bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle has small trust in indulgences,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All lies, of course,&rdquo; quoth Hugh; &ldquo;yet
they&rsquo;ve the Pope&rsquo;s seal, and I have more than half a
mind to get one.&nbsp; Five hundred years is no joke, and I am
sure of purgatory, since I bought this medal at the Holy House of
Loretto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went forward, and invested six groschen in one of the
papers, the most religious action poor Christina had ever seen
him perform.&nbsp; Other purchasers came forward&mdash;several,
of the castle <i>knappen</i>, and a few peasant women who offered
yarn or cheeses as equivalents for money, but were told with some
insolence to go and sell their goods, and bring the coin.</p>
<p>After a time, the friar, finding his traffic slack, thought
fit to remove, with his two lay assistants, outside the chapel,
and try the effects of an out-of-door sermon.&nbsp; Hugh Sorel,
who had been hitherto rather diverted by the man&rsquo;s gestures
and persuasions, now decided on going out into the fair in quest
of an escort for his daughter, but as she saw Father Norbert and
another monk ascending from the stairs leading to the
hermit&rsquo;s cell, she begged to be allowed to remain in the
church, where she was sure to be safe, instead of wandering about
with him in the fair.</p>
<p>He was glad to be unencumbered, though he thought her taste
unnatural; and, promising to return for her when he had found an
escort, he left her.</p>
<p>Father Norbert had come for the very purpose of hearing
confessions, and Christina&rsquo;s next hour was the most
comfortable she had spent since Ermentrude&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>After this however the priests were called away, and long,
long did Christina first kneel and then sit in the little lonely
church, hearing the various sounds without, and imagining that
her father had forgotten her, and that he and all the rest were
drinking, and then what would become of her?&nbsp; Why had she
quitted old Ursel&rsquo;s protection?</p>
<p>Hours of waiting and nameless alarm must have passed, for the
sun was waxing low, when at length she heard steps coming up the
hermit&rsquo;s cell, and a head rose above the pavement which she
recognized with a wild throb of joy, but, repressing her sense of
gladness, she only exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, where is my
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent him to the toll at the Gemsbock&rsquo;s
Pass,&rdquo; replied Sir Eberhard, who had by this time come up
the stairs, followed by Brother Peter and the two lay
assistants.&nbsp; Then, as Christina turned on him her startled,
terrified eyes in dismay and reproach for such thoughtlessness,
he came towards her, and, bending his head and opening his hand,
he showed on his palm two gold rings.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, little
one,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;now shalt thou never again shut me
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her senses grew dizzy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she faintly
said, &ldquo;this is no place to delude a poor maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I delude thee not.&nbsp; The brother here waits to wed
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&nbsp; A burgher maid is not for such as
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None but a burgher maid will I wed,&rdquo; returned Sir
Eberhard, with all the settled resolution of habits of
command.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, Christina, thou art sweeter and better
than any lady in the land; thou canst make me what she&mdash;the
blessed one who lies there&mdash;would have me.&nbsp; I love thee
as never knight loved lady.&nbsp; I love thee so that I have not
spoken a word to offend thee when my heart was bursting;
and&rdquo;&mdash;as he saw her irrepressible tears&mdash;&ldquo;I
think thou lovest me a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she gasped with a sob, &ldquo;let me
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou canst not go home; there is none here fit to take
charge of thee.&nbsp; Or if there were, I would slay him rather
than let thee go.&nbsp; No, not so,&rdquo; he said, as he saw how
little those words served his cause; &ldquo;but without thee I
were a mad and desperate man.&nbsp; Christina, I will not answer
for myself if thou dost not leave this place my wedded
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; implored Christina, &ldquo;if you would only
betroth me, and woo me like an honourable maiden from my home at
Ulm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betroth thee, ay, and wed thee at once,&rdquo; replied
Eberhard, who, all along, even while his words were most
pleading, had worn a look and manner of determined authority and
strength, good-natured indeed, but resolved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
not going to miss my opportunity, or baulk the friar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friar, who had meantime been making a few needful
arrangements for the ceremony, advanced towards them.&nbsp; He
was a good-humoured, easy-going man, who came prepared to do any
office that came in his way on such festival days at the villages
round; and peasant marriages at such times were not
uncommon.&nbsp; But something now staggered him, and he said
anxiously&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This maiden looks convent-bred!&nbsp; Herr Reiter,
pardon me; but if this be the breaking of a cloister, I can have
none of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; said Eberhard; &ldquo;she is
town-bred, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would swear to it, on the holy mass yonder, both of
you?&rdquo; said the friar, still suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; replied Eberhard, &ldquo;and so dost thou,
Christina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the time if ever to struggle against her
destiny.&nbsp; The friar would probably have listened to her if
she had made any vehement opposition to a forced marriage, and if
not, a few shrieks would have brought perhaps Father Norbert, and
certainly the whole population; but the horror and shame of being
found in such a situation, even more than the probability that
she might meet with vengeance rather than protection, withheld
her.&nbsp; Even the friar could hardly have removed her, and this
was her only chance of safety from the Baroness&rsquo;s
fury.&nbsp; Had she hated and loathed Sir Eberhard, perhaps she
had striven harder, but his whole demeanour constrained and
quelled her, and the chief effort she made against yielding was
the reply, &ldquo;I am no cloister maid, holy father,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;but&rdquo; was lost in the friar&rsquo;s jovial
speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, then, all is well!&nbsp; Take thy place,
pretty one, there, by the door, thou know&rsquo;st it should be
in the porch, but&mdash;ach, I understand!&rdquo; as Eberhard
quietly drew the bolt within.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, little one, I
have no time for bride scruples and coyness; I have to train
three dull-headed louts to be Shem, Ham, and Japhet before
dark.&nbsp; Hast confessed of late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning, but&mdash;&rdquo; said Christina, and
&ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; to her great joy, said Eberhard, and,
in her satisfaction thereat, her second &ldquo;but&rdquo; was not
followed up.</p>
<p>The friar asked their names, and both gave the Christian name
alone; then the brief and simple rite was solemnized in its
shortest form.&nbsp; Christina had, by very force of surprise and
dismay, gone through all without signs of agitation, except the
quivering of her whole frame, and the icy coldness of the hand,
where Eberhard had to place the ring on each finger in turn.</p>
<p>But each mutual vow was a strange relief to her long-tossed
and divided mind, and it was rest indeed to let her affection
have its will, and own him indeed as a protector to be loved
instead of shunned.&nbsp; When all was over, and he gathered the
two little cold hands into his large one, his arm supporting her
trembling form, she felt for the moment, poor little thing, as if
she could never be frightened again.</p>
<p>Parish registers were not, even had this been a parish church,
but Brother Peter asked, when he had concluded, &ldquo;Well, my
son, which of his flock am I to report to your Pfarrer as linked
together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The less your tongue wags on that matter till I call on
you, the better,&rdquo; was the stern reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look
you, no ill shall befall you if you are wise, but remember,
against the day I call you to bear witness, that you have this
day wedded Baron Eberhard von Adlerstein the younger, to
Christina, the daughter of Hugh Sorel, the Esquire of
Ulm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast played me a trick, Sir Baron!&rdquo; said the
friar, somewhat dismayed, but more amused, looking up at
Eberhard, who, as Christina now saw, had divested himself of his
gilt spurs, gold chain, silvered belt and horn, and eagle&rsquo;s
plume, so as to have passed for a simple lanzknecht.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would have had no such gear as this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I supposed,&rdquo; said Eberhard coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young folks! young folks!&rdquo; laughed the friar,
changing his tone, and holding up his finger slyly; &ldquo;the
little bird so cunningly nestled in the church to fly out my Lady
Baroness!&nbsp; Well, so thou hast a pretty, timid lambkin there,
Sir Baron.&nbsp; Take care you use her mildly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eberhard looked into Christina&rsquo;s face with a smile, that
to her, at least, was answer enough; and he held out half a dozen
links of his gold chain to the friar, and tossed a coin to each
of the lay brethren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the poor friar himself,&rdquo; explained
Brother Peter, on receiving this marriage fee; &ldquo;it all goes
to the weal of the brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said Eberhard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Silence, that is all!&nbsp; And thy
friary&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor house of St. Francis at Offingen for the
present, noble sir,&rdquo; said the priest.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
will you hear of me, if you find me not.&nbsp; And now, fare thee
well, my gracious lady.&nbsp; I hope one day thou wilt have more
words to thank the poor brother who has made thee a noble
Baroness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, good father, pardon my fright and confusion,&rdquo;
Christina tried to murmur, but at that moment a sudden glow and
glare of light broke out on the eastern rock, illuminating the
fast darkening little church with a flickering glare, that made
her start in terror as if the fires of heaven were threatening
this stolen marriage; but the friar and Eberhard both exclaimed,
&ldquo;The Needfire alight already!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
recollected how often she had seen these bonfires on Midsummer
night shining red on every hill around Ulm.&nbsp; Loud shouts
were greeting the uprising flame, and the people gathering
thicker and thicker on the slope.&nbsp; The friar undid the door
to hasten out into the throng, and Eberhard said he had left his
spurs and belt in the hermit&rsquo;s cell, and must return
thither, after which he would walk home with his bride, moving at
the same time towards the stair, and thereby causing a sudden
scuffle and fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;So, master hermit,&rdquo; quoth
Eberhard, as the old man picked himself up, looking horribly
frightened; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your hermit&rsquo;s abstraction,
is it?&nbsp; No whining, old man, I am not going to hurt thee, so
thou canst hold thy tongue.&nbsp; Otherwise I will smoke thee out
of thy hole like a wild cat!&nbsp; What, thou aiding me with my
belt, my lovely one?&nbsp; Thanks; the snap goes too hard for thy
little hands.&nbsp; Now, then, the fire will light us gaily down
the mountain side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it soon appeared that to depart was impossible, unless by
forcing a way through the busy throng in the full red glare of
the firelight, and they were forced to pause at the opening of
the hermit&rsquo;s cave, Christina leaning on her husband&rsquo;s
arm, and a fold of his mantle drawn round her to guard her from
the night-breeze of the mountain, as they waited for a quiet
space in which to depart unnoticed.&nbsp; It was a strange, wild
scene!&nbsp; The fire was on a bare, flat rock, which probably
had been yearly so employed ever since the Kelts had brought from
the East the rite that they had handed on to the
Swabians&mdash;the Beltane fire, whose like was blazing
everywhere in the Alps, in the Hartz, nay, even in England,
Scotland, and on the granite points of Ireland.&nbsp; Heaped up
for many previous days with faggots from the forest, then
apparently inexhaustible, the fire roared and crackled, and rose
high, red and smoky, into the air, paling the moon, and obscuring
the stars.&nbsp; Round it, completely hiding the bonfire itself,
were hosts of dark figures swarming to approach it&mdash;all with
a purpose.&nbsp; All held old shoes or superannuated garments in
their hands to feed the flame; for it was esteemed needful that
every villager should contribute something from his
house&mdash;once, no doubt, as an offering to Bel, but now as a
mere unmeaning observance.&nbsp; And shrieks of merriment
followed the contribution of each too well-known article of
rubbish that had been in reserve for the Needfire!&nbsp; Girls
and boys had nuts to throw in, in pairs, to judge by their
bounces of future chances of matrimony.&nbsp; Then came a
shouting, tittering, and falling back, as an old boor came
forward like a priest with something heavy and ghastly in his
arms, which was thrown on with a tremendous shout, darkened the
glow for a moment, then hissed, cracked, and emitted a horrible
odour.</p>
<p>It was a horse&rsquo;s head, the right owner of which had been
carefully kept for the occasion, though long past work.&nbsp;
Christina shuddered, and felt as if she had fallen upon a Pagan
ceremony; as indeed was true enough, only that the Adlersteiners
attached no meaning to the performance, except a vague notion of
securing good luck.</p>
<p>With the same idea the faggots were pulled down, and arranged
so as to form a sort of lane of fire.&nbsp; Young men rushed
along it, and then bounded over the diminished pile, amid loud
shouts of laughter and either admiration or derision; and, in the
meantime, a variety of odd, recusant noises, grunts, squeaks, and
lowings proceeding from the darkness were explained to the
startled little bride by her husband to come from all the cattle
of the mountain farms around, who were to have their weal secured
by being driven through the Needfire.</p>
<p>It may well be imagined that the animals were less convinced
of the necessity of this performance than their masters.&nbsp;
Wonderful was the clatter and confusion, horrible the uproar
raised behind to make the poor things proceed at all, desperate
the shout when some half-frantic creature kicked or attempted a
charge wild the glee when a persecuted goat or sheep took heart
of grace, and flashed for one moment between the crackling,
flaring, smoking walls.&nbsp; When one cow or sheep off a farm
went, all the others were pretty sure to follow it, and the owner
had then only to be on the watch at the other end to turn them
back, with their flame-dazzled eyes, from going unawares down the
precipice, a fate from which the passing through the fire was
evidently not supposed to ensure them.&nbsp; The swine, those
special German delights, were of course the most refractory of
all.&nbsp; Some, by dint of being pulled away from the lane of
fire, were induced to rush through it; but about half-way they
generally made a bolt, either sidelong through the flaming fence
or backwards among the legs of their persecutors, who were upset
amid loud imprecations.&nbsp; One huge, old, lean, high-backed
sow, with a large family, truly feminine in her want of presence
of mind, actually charged into the midst of the bonfire itself,
scattering it to the right and left with her snout, and emitting
so horrible a smell of singed bacon, that it might almost be
feared that some of her progeny were anticipating the invention
of Chinese roasting-pigs.&nbsp; However, their proprietor, Jobst,
counted them out all safe on the other side, and there only
resulted some sighs and lamentations among the seniors, such as
Hatto and Ursel, that it boded ill to have the Needfire trodden
out by an old sow.</p>
<p>All the castle live-stock were undergoing the same
ceremony.&nbsp; Eberhard concerned himself little about the
vagaries of the sheep and pigs, and only laughed a little as the
great black goat, who had seen several Midsummer nights, and
stood on his guard, made a sudden short run and butted down old
Hatto, then skipped off like a chamois into the darkness,
unheeding, the old rogue, the whispers that connected his unlucky
hue with the doings of the Walpurgisnacht.&nbsp; But when it came
to the horses, Eberhard could not well endure the sight of the
endeavours to force them, snorting, rearing, and struggling,
through anything so abhorrent to them as the hedge of fire.</p>
<p>The Schneiderlein, with all the force of his powerful arm, had
hold of Eberhard&rsquo;s own young white mare, who, with ears
turned back, nostrils dilated, and wild eyes, her fore-feet
firmly planted wide apart, was using her whole strength for
resistance; and, when a heavy blow fell on her, only plunged
backwards, and kicked without advancing.&nbsp; It was more than
Eberhard could endure, and Christina&rsquo;s impulse was to
murmur, &ldquo;O do not let him do it;&rdquo; but this he
scarcely heard, as he exclaimed, &ldquo;Wait for me here!&rdquo;
and, as he stepped forward, sent his voice before him, forbidding
all blows to the mare.</p>
<p>The creature&rsquo;s extreme terror ceased at once upon
hearing his voice, and there was an instant relaxation of all
violence of resistance as he came up to her, took her halter from
the Schneiderlein, patted her glossy neck, and spoke to
her.&nbsp; But the tumult of warning voices around him assured
him that it would be a fatal thing to spare the steed the passage
through the fire, and he strove by encouragements and caresses
with voice and hand to get her forward, leading her himself; but
the poor beast trembled so violently, and, though making a few
steps forward, stopped again in such exceeding horror of the
flame, that Eberhard had not the heart to compel her, turned her
head away, and assured her that she should not be further
tormented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gracious lordship is wrong,&rdquo; said public
opinion, by the voice of old Bauer Ulrich, the sacrificer of the
horse&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven forfend that evil befall
him and that mare in the course of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the buzz of voices concurred in telling of the recusant
pigs who had never developed into sausages, the sheep who had
only escaped to be eaten by wolves, the mule whose bones had been
found at the bottom of an abyss.</p>
<p>Old Ursel was seriously concerned, and would have laid hold on
her young master to remonstrate, but a fresh notion had
arisen&mdash;Would the gracious Freiherr set a-rolling the wheel,
which was already being lighted in the fire, and was to conclude
the festivities by being propelled down the hill&mdash;figuring,
only that no one present knew it, the sun&rsquo;s declension from
his solstitial height?&nbsp; Eberhard made no objection; and
Christina, in her shelter by the cave, felt no little dismay at
being left alone there, and moreover had a strange, weird feeling
at the wild, uncanny ceremony he was engaged in, not knowing
indeed that it was sun-worship, but afraid that it could be no
other than unholy sorcery.</p>
<p>The wheel, flaring or reddening in all its spokes, was raised
from the bonfire, and was driven down the smoothest piece of
green sward, which formed an inclined plane towards the
stream.&nbsp; If its course was smooth, and it only became
extinguished by leaping into the water, the village would
flourish; and prosperity above all was expected if it should
spring over the narrow channel, and attempt to run up the other
side.&nbsp; Such things had happened in the days of the good
Freiherren Ebbo and Friedel, though the wheel had never gone
right since the present baron had been excommunicated; but his
heir having been twice seen at mass in this last month great
hopes were founded upon him.</p>
<p>There was a shout to clear the slope.&nbsp; Eberhard, in great
earnest and some anxiety, accepted the gauntlet that he was
offered to protect his hand, steadied the wheel therewith, and,
with a vigorous impulse from hand and foot, sent it bounding down
the slope, among loud cries and a general scattering of the
idlers who had crowded full into the very path of the fiery
circle, which flamed up brilliantly for the moment as it met the
current of air.&nbsp; But either there was an obstacle in the
way, or the young Baron&rsquo;s push had not been quite straight:
the wheel suddenly swerved aside, its course swerved to the
right, maugre all the objurgations addressed to it as if it had
been a living thing, and the next moment it had disappeared, all
but a smoky, smouldering spot of red, that told where it lay,
charring and smoking on its side, without having fulfilled a
quarter of its course.</p>
<p>People drew off gravely and silently, and Eberhard himself was
strangely discomfited when he came back to the hermitage, and,
wrapping Christina in his cloak, prepared to return, so soon as
the glare of the fire should have faded from his eyesight enough
to make it safe to tread so precipitous a path.&nbsp; He had
indeed this day made a dangerous venture, and both he and
Christina could not but feel disheartened by the issue of all the
omens of the year, the more because she had a vague sense of
wrong in consulting or trusting them.&nbsp; It seemed to her all
one frightened, uncomprehended dream ever since her father had
left her in the chapel; and, though conscious of her inability to
have prevented her marriage, yet she blamed herself, felt
despairing as she thought of the future, and, above all, dreaded
the Baron and the Baroness and their anger.&nbsp; Eberhard, after
his first few words, was silent, and seemed solely absorbed in
leading her safely along the rocky path, sometimes lifting her
when he thought her in danger of stumbling.&nbsp; It was one of
the lightest, shortest nights of the year, and a young moon added
to the brightness in open places, while in others it made the
rocks and stones cast strange elvish shadows.&nbsp; The distance
was not entirely lost; other Beltane fires could be seen, like
beacons, on every hill, and the few lights in the castle shone
out like red fiery eyes in its heavy dark pile of building.</p>
<p>Before entering, Eberhard paused, pulled off his own
wedding-ring, and put it into his bosom, and taking his
bride&rsquo;s hand in his, did the same for her, and bade her
keep the ring till they could wear them openly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! then,&rdquo; said Christina, &ldquo;you would
have this secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I would have to seek thee down the oubliette, my
little one,&rdquo; said Eberhard &ldquo;or, what might even be
worse, see thee burnt on the hillside for bewitching me with
thine arts!&nbsp; No, indeed, my darling.&nbsp; Were it only my
father, I could make him love thee; but my mother&mdash;I could
not trust her where she thought the honour of our house
concerned.&nbsp; It shall not be for long.&nbsp; Thou
know&rsquo;st we are to make peace with the Kaiser, and then will
I get me employment among K&uuml;rfurst Albrecht&rsquo;s
companies of troops, and then shalt thou prank it as my Lady
Freiherrinn, and teach me the ways of cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I fear me it has been a great sin!&rdquo;
sighed the poor little wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For thee&mdash;thou couldst not help it,&rdquo; said
Eberhard; &ldquo;for me&mdash;who knows how many deadly ones it
may hinder?&nbsp; Cheer up, little one; no one can harm thee
while the secret is kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Christina had no choice but submission; but it was a
sorry bridal evening, to enter her husband&rsquo;s home in
shrinking terror; with the threat of the oubliette before her,
and with a sense of shame and deception hanging upon her, making
the wonted scowl of the old baroness cut her both with remorse
and dread.</p>
<p>She did indeed sit beside her bridegroom at the supper, but
how little like a bride! even though he pushed the salt-cellar,
as if by accident, below her place.&nbsp; She thought of her
myrtle, tended in vain at home by Barbara Schmidt; she thought of
Ulm courtships, and how all ought to have been; the solemn
embassage to her uncle, the stately negotiations; the troth
plight before the circle of ceremonious kindred and merry
maidens, of whom she had often been one&mdash;the subsequent
attentions of the betrothed on all festival days, the piles of
linen and all plenishings accumulated since babyhood, and all
reviewed and laid out for general admiration (Ah! poor Aunt
Johanna still spinning away to add to the many webs in her walnut
presses!)&mdash;then the grand procession to fetch home the
bride, the splendid festival with the musicians, dishes, and
guest-tables to the utmost limit that was allowed by the city
laws, and the bride&rsquo;s hair so joyously covered by her
matron&rsquo;s curch amid the merriment of her companion
maidens.</p>
<p>Poor child!&nbsp; After she had crept away to her own room,
glad that her father was not yet returned, she wept bitterly over
the wrong that she felt she had done to the kind uncle and aunt,
who must now look in vain for their little Christina, and would
think her lost to them, and to all else that was good.&nbsp; At
least she had had the Church&rsquo;s blessing&mdash;but that,
strange to say, was regarded, in burgher life before the
Reformation, as rather the ornament of a noble marriage than as
essential to the civil contract; and a marriage by a priest was
regarded by the citizens rather as a means of eluding the need of
obtaining the parent&rsquo;s consent, than as a more regular and
devout manner of wedding.&nbsp; However, Christina felt this the
one drop of peace.&nbsp; The blessings and prayers were warm at
her heart, and gave her hope.&nbsp; And as to drops of joy, of
them there was no lack, for had not she now a right to love
Eberhard with all her heart and conscience, and was not it a
wonderful love on his part that had made him stoop to the little
white-faced burgher maid, despised even by her own father?&nbsp;
O better far to wear the maiden&rsquo;s uncovered head for him
than the myrtle wreath for any one else!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SCHNEIDERLEIN&rsquo;S
RETURN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> poor little unowned bride had
more to undergo than her imagination had conceived at the first
moment.</p>
<p>When she heard that the marriage was to be a secret, she had
not understood that Eberhard was by no means disposed to observe
much more caution than mere silence.&nbsp; A rough, though kindly
man, he did not thoroughly comprehend the shame and confusion
that he was bringing upon her by departing from his former
demeanour.&nbsp; He knew that, so enormous was the distance then
supposed to exist between the noble and the burgher, there was no
chance of any one dreaming of the true state of the case, and
that as long as Christina was not taken for his wife, there was
no personal danger for her from his mother, who&mdash;so lax were
the morals of the German nobility with regard to all of inferior
rank&mdash;would tolerate her with complacency as his favourite
toy; and he was taken by surprise at the agony of grief and shame
with which she slowly comprehended his assurance that she had
nothing to fear.</p>
<p>There was no help for it.&nbsp; The oubliette would probably
be the portion of the low-born girl who had interfered with the
sixteen quarterings of the Adlerstein shield, and poor Christina
never stepped across its trap-door without a shudder lest it
should open beneath her.&nbsp; And her father would probably have
been hung from the highest tower, in spite of his shrewd care to
be aware of nothing.&nbsp; Christina consoled herself with the
hope that he knew all the time why he had been sent out of the
way, for, with a broad grin that had made her blush painfully, he
had said he knew she would be well taken care of, and that he
hoped she was not breaking her heart for want of an escort.&nbsp;
She tried to extort Eberhard&rsquo;s permission to let him at
least know how it was; but Eberhard laughed, saying he believed
the old fox knew just as much as he chose; and, in effect, Sorel,
though now and then gratifying his daughter&rsquo;s scruples, by
serving as a shield to her meetings with the young Baron, never
allowed himself to hear a hint of the true state of affairs.</p>
<p>Eberhard&rsquo;s love and reverence were undiminished, and the
time spent with him would have been perfectly happy could she
ever have divested herself of anxiety and alarm; but the periods
of his absence from the castle were very terrible to her, for the
other women of the household, quick to perceive that she no
longer repelled him, had lost that awe that had hitherto kept
them at a distance from her, and treated her with a familiarity,
sometimes coarse, sometimes spiteful, always hateful and
degrading.&nbsp; Even old Ursel had become half-pitying,
half-patronizing; and the old Baroness, though not molesting her,
took not the slightest notice of her.</p>
<p>This state of things lasted much longer than there had been
reason to expect at the time of the marriage.&nbsp; The two
Freiherren then intended to set out in a very short time to make
their long talked-of submission to the Emperor at Ratisbon; but,
partly from their German tardiness of movement, partly from the
obstinate delays interposed by the proud old Freiherrinn, who was
as averse as ever to the measure, partly from reports that the
Court was not yet arrived at Ratisbon, the expedition was again
and again deferred, and did not actually take place till
September was far advanced.</p>
<p>Poor Christina would have given worlds to go with them, and
even entreated to be sent to Ulm with an avowal of her marriage
to her uncle and aunt, but of this Eberhard would not hear.&nbsp;
He said the Ulmers would thus gain an hostage, and hamper his
movements; and, if her wedding was not to be confessed&mdash;poor
child!&mdash;she could better bear to remain where she was than
to face Hausfrau Johanna.&nbsp; Eberhard was fully determined to
enrol himself in some troop, either Imperial, or, if not, among
the Free Companies, among whom men of rank were often found, and
he would then fetch or send for his wife and avow her openly, so
soon as she should be out of his mother&rsquo;s reach.&nbsp; He
longed to leave her father at home, to be some protection to her,
but Hugh Sorel was so much the most intelligent and skilful of
the retainers as to be absolutely indispensable to the
party&mdash;he was their only scribe; and moreover his new suit
of buff rendered him a creditable member of a troop that had been
very hard to equip.&nbsp; It numbered about ten men-at-arms, only
three being left at home to garrison the castle&mdash;namely,
Hatto, who was too old to take; Hans, who had been hopelessly
lame and deformed since the old Baron had knocked him off a cliff
in a passion; and Squinting M&auml;tz, a runaway servant, who had
murdered his master, the mayor of Strasburg, and might be caught
and put to death if any one recognized him.&nbsp; If needful the
villagers could always be called in to defend the castle: but of
this there was little or no danger&mdash;the Eagle&rsquo;s Steps
were defence enough in themselves, and the party were not likely
to be absent more than a week or ten days&mdash;a grievous length
of time, poor Christina thought, as she stood straining her eyes
on the top of the watch-tower, to watch them as far as possible
along the plain.&nbsp; Her heart was very sad, and the omen of
the burning wheel so continually haunted her that even in her
sleep that night she saw its brief course repeated, beheld its
rapid fall and extinction, and then tracked the course of the
sparks that darted from it, one rising and gleaming high in air
till it shone like a star, another pursuing a fitful and
irregular, but still bright course amid the dry grass on the
hillside, just as she had indeed watched some of the sparks on
that night, minding her of the words of the Allhallow-tide
legend: &ldquo;<i>Fulgebunt justi et tanquam scintill&aelig; in
arundinete discurrent</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a sentence which remained
with her when awake, and led her to seek it out in her Latin
Bible in the morning.</p>
<p>Reluctantly had she gone down to the noontide meal, feeling,
though her husband and father were far less of guardians than
they should have been, yet that there was absolute rest, peace,
and protection in their presence compared with what it was to be
alone with Freiherrinn Kunigunde and her rude women without
them.&nbsp; A few sneers on her daintiness and uselessness had
led her to make an offer of assisting in the grand chopping of
sausage meat and preparation of winter stores, and she had been
answered with contempt that my young lord would not have her soil
her delicate hands, when one of the maids who had been sent to
fetch beer from the cellar came back with startled looks, and the
exclamation, &ldquo;There is the Schneiderlein riding up the
Eagle&rsquo;s Ladder upon Freiherr Ebbo&rsquo;s white
mare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the women sprang up together, and rushed to the window,
whence they could indeed recognize both man and horse; and
presently it became plain that both were stained with blood,
weary, and spent; indeed, nothing but extreme exhaustion would
have induced the man-at-arms to trust the tired, stumbling horse
up such a perilous path.</p>
<p>Loud were the exclamations, &ldquo;Ah! no good could come of
not leading that mare through the Johannisfeuer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shameful expedition!&nbsp; Only harm could
befall.&nbsp; This is thy doing, thou mincing
city-girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All was certain to go wrong when a pale mist widow came
into the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The angry and dismayed cries all blended themselves in
confusion in the ears of the only silent woman present; the only
one that sounded distinctly on her brain was that of the last
speaker, &ldquo;A pale, mist widow,&rdquo; as, holding herself a
little in the rear of the struggling, jostling little mob of
women, who hardly made way even for their acknowledged lady, she
followed with failing limbs the universal rush to the entrance as
soon as man and horse had mounted the slope and were lost sight
of.</p>
<p>A few moments more, and the throng of expectants was at the
foot of the hall steps, just as the lanzknecht reached the arched
entrance.&nbsp; His comrade Hans took his bridle, and almost
lifted him from his horse; he reeled and stumbled as, pale,
battered, and bleeding, he tried to advance to Freiherinn
Kunigunde, and, in answer to her hasty interrogation, faltered
out, &ldquo;Ill news, gracious lady.&nbsp; We have been set upon
by the accursed Schlangenwaldern, and I am the only living man
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina scarce heard even these last words; senses and
powers alike failed her, and she sank back on the stone steps in
a deathlike swoon.</p>
<p>When she came to herself she was lying on her bed, Ursel and
Else, another of the women, busy over her, and Ursel&rsquo;s
voice was saying, &ldquo;Ah, she is coming round.&nbsp; Look up,
sweet lady, and fear not.&nbsp; You are our gracious Lady
Baroness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here?&nbsp; O, has he said so?&nbsp; O, let me
see him&mdash;Sir Eberhard,&rdquo; faintly cried Christina with
sobbing breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, no,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;but see
here,&rdquo; and she lifted up Christina&rsquo;s powerless,
bloodless hand, and showed her the ring on the finger.&nbsp; Her
bosom had been evidently searched when her dress was loosened in
her swoon, and her ring found and put in its place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, you can hold up your head with the best of them; he
took care of that&mdash;my dear young Freiherr, the boy that I
nursed,&rdquo; and the old woman&rsquo;s burst of tears brought
back the truth to Christina&rsquo;s reviving senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell me,&rdquo; she said, trying to raise herself,
&ldquo;was it indeed so?&nbsp; O say it was not as he
said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, woe&rsquo;s me, woe&rsquo;s me, that it was even
so,&rdquo; lamented Ursel; &ldquo;but oh, be still, look not so
wild, dear lady.&nbsp; The dear, true-hearted young lord, he
spent his last breath in owning you for his true lady, and in
bidding us cherish you and our young baron that is to be.&nbsp;
And the gracious lady below&mdash;she owns you; there is no fear
of her now; so vex not yourself, dearest, most gracious
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina did not break out into the wailing and weeping that
the old nurse expected; she was still far too much stunned and
overwhelmed, and she entreated to be told all, lying still, but
gazing at Ursel with piteous bewildered eyes.&nbsp; Ursel and
Else helping one another out, tried to tell her, but they were
much confused; all they knew was that the party had been
surprised at night in a village hostel by the Schlangenwaldern,
and all slain, though the young Baron had lived long enough to
charge the Schneiderlein with his commendation of his wife to his
mother; but all particulars had been lost in the general
confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let me see the Schneiderlein,&rdquo; implored
Christina, by this time able to rise and cross the room to the
large carved chair; and Ursel immediately turned to her
underling, saying, &ldquo;Tell the Schneiderlein that the
gracious Lady Baroness desires his presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Else&rsquo;s wooden shoes clattered down stairs, but the next
moment she returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;He cannot come; he is quite
spent, and he will let no one touch his arm till Ursel can come,
not even to get off his doublet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to him,&rdquo; said Christina, and, revived
by the sense of being wanted, she moved at once to the turret,
where she kept some rag and some ointment, which she had found
needful in the latter stages of Ermentrude&rsquo;s
illness&mdash;indeed, household surgery was a part of regular
female education, and Christina had had plenty of practice in
helping her charitable aunt, so that the superiority of her skill
to that of Ursel had long been avowed in the castle.&nbsp; Ursel
made no objection further than to look for something that could
be at once converted into a widow&rsquo;s veil&mdash;being in the
midst of her grief quite alive to the need that no matronly badge
should be omitted&mdash;but nothing came to hand in time, and
Christina was descending the stairs, on her way to the kitchen,
where she found the fugitive man-at-arms seated on a rough
settle, his head and wounded arm resting on the table, while
groans of pain, weariness, and impatience were interspersed with
imprecations on the stupid awkward girls who surrounded him.</p>
<p>Pity and the instinct of affording relief must needs take the
precedence even of the desire to hear of her husband&rsquo;s
fate; and, as the girls hastily whispered, &ldquo;Here she
is,&rdquo; and the lanzknecht hastily tried to gather himself up,
and rise with tokens of respect; she bade him remain still, and
let her see what she could do for him.&nbsp; In fact, she at once
perceived that he was in no condition to give a coherent account
of anything, he was so completely worn out, and in so much
suffering.&nbsp; She bade at once that some water should be
heated, and some of the broth of the dinner set on the fire; then
with the shears at her girdle, and her soft, light fingers, she
removed the torn strip of cloth that had been wound round the
arm, and cut away the sleeve, showing the arm not broken, but
gashed at the shoulder, and thence the whole length grazed and
wounded by the descent of the sword down to the wrist.&nbsp; So
tender was her touch, that he scarcely winced or moaned under her
hand; and, when she proceeded, with Ursel&rsquo;s help, to bathe
the wound with the warm water, the relief was such that the
wearied man absolutely slumbered during the process, which
Christina protracted on that very account.&nbsp; She then dressed
and bandaged the arm, and proceeded to skim&mdash;as no one else
in the castle would do&mdash;the basin of soup, with which she
then fed her patient as he leant back in the corner of the
settle, at first in the same somnolent, half-conscious state in
which he had been ever since the relief from the severe pain; but
after a few spoonfuls the light and life came back to his eye,
and he broke out, &ldquo;Thanks, thanks, gracious lady!&nbsp;
This is the Lady Baroness for me!&nbsp; My young lord was the
only wise man!&nbsp; Thanks, lady; now am I my own man
again.&nbsp; It had been long ere the old Freiherrinn had done so
much for me!&nbsp; I am your man, lady, for life or
death!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, before she knew what he was about, the
gigantic Schneiderlein had slid down on his knees, seized her
hand, and kissed it&mdash;the first act of homage to her rank,
but most startling and distressing to her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;prithee do not; thou must
rest.&nbsp; Only if&mdash;if thou canst only tell me if he, my
own dear lord, sent me any greeting, I would wait to hear the
rest till thou hast slept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! the dog of Schlangenwald!&rdquo; was the first
answer; then, as he continued, &ldquo;You see, lady, we had
ridden merrily as far as Jacob M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s hostel, the
traitor,&rdquo; it became plain that he meant to begin at the
beginning.&nbsp; She allowed Ursel to seat her on the bench
opposite to his settle, and, leaning forward, heard his narrative
like one in a dream.&nbsp; There, the Schneiderlein proceeded to
say, they put up for the night, entirely unsuspicious of evil;
Jacob M&uuml;ller, who was known to himself, as well as to Sorel
and to the others, assuring them that the way was clear to
Ratisbon, and that he heard the Emperor was most favourably
disposed to any noble who would tender his allegiance.&nbsp;
Jacob&rsquo;s liquors were brought out, and were still in course
of being enjoyed, when the house was suddenly surrounded by an
overpowering number of the retainers of Schlangenwald, with their
Count himself at their head.&nbsp; He had been evidently resolved
to prevent the timely submission of the enemies of his race, and
suddenly presenting himself before the elder Baron, had
challenged him to instantaneous battle, claiming credit to
himself for not having surprised them when asleep.&nbsp; The
disadvantage had been scarcely less than if this had been the
case, for the Adlersteinern were all half-intoxicated, and far
inferior in numbers&mdash;at least, on the showing of the
Schneiderlein&mdash;and a desperate fight had ended by his being
flung aside in a corner, bound fast by the ankles and wrists, the
only living prisoner, except his young lord, who, having several
terrible wounds, the worst in his chest, was left unbound.</p>
<p>Both lay helpless, untended, and silent, while the revel that
had been so fatal to them was renewed by their captors, who
finally all sunk into a heavy sleep.&nbsp; The torches were not
all spent, and the moonlight shone into the room, when the
Schneiderlein, desperate from the agony caused by the ligature
round his wounded arm, sat up and looked about him.&nbsp; A knife
thrown aside by one of the drunkards lay near enough to be
grasped by his bound hands, and he had just reached it when Sir
Eberhard made a sign to him to put it into his hand, and
therewith contrived to cut the rope round both hands and
feet&mdash;then pointed to the door.</p>
<p>There was nothing to hinder an escape; the men slept the sleep
of the drunken; but the Schneiderlein, with the rough fidelity of
a retainer, would have lingered with a hope of saving his
master.&nbsp; But Eberhard shook his head, and signed again to
escape; then, making him bend down close to him, he used all his
remaining power to whisper, as he pressed his sword into the
retainer&rsquo;s hand,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home; tell my mother&mdash;all the world&mdash;that
Christina Sorel is my wife, wedded on the Friedmund Wake by Friar
Peter of Offingen, and if she should bear a child, he is my true
and lawful heir.&nbsp; My sword for him&mdash;my love to
her.&nbsp; And if my mother would not be haunted by me, let her
take care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were spoken with extreme difficulty, for the
nature of the wound made utterance nearly impossible, and each
broken sentence cost a terrible effusion of blood.&nbsp; The
final words brought on so choking and fatal a gush that, said the
Schneiderlein, &ldquo;he fell back as I tried to hold him up, and
I saw that it was all at an end, and a kind and friendly master
and lord gone from me.&nbsp; I laid him down, and put his cross
on his breast that I had seen him kissing many a time that
evening; and I crossed his hands, and wiped the blood from them
and his face.&nbsp; And, lady, he had put on his ring; I trust
the robber caitiff&rsquo;s may have left it to him in his
grave.&nbsp; And so I came forth, walking soft, and opening the
door in no small dread, not of the snoring swine, but of the dogs
without.&nbsp; But happily they were still, and even by the door
I saw all our poor fellows stark and stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father?&rdquo; asked Christina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! with his head cleft open by the Graf himself.&nbsp;
He died like a true soldier, lady, and we have lost the best head
among us in him.&nbsp; Well, the knave that should have watched
the horses was as drunken as the rest of them, and I made a shift
to put the bridle on the white mare and ride off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the narrative of the Schneiderlein, and all that was
left to Christina was the picture of her husband&rsquo;s dying
effort to guard her, and the haunting fancy of those long hours
of speechless agony on the floor of the hostel, and how direful
must have been his fears for her.&nbsp; Sad and overcome, yet not
sinking entirely while any work of comfort remained, her heart
yearned over her companion in misfortune, the mother who had lost
both husband and son; and all her fears of the dread Freiherrinn
could not prevent her from bending her steps, trembling and
palpitating as she was, towards the hall, to try whether the
daughter-in-law&rsquo;s right might be vouchsafed to her, of
weeping with the elder sufferer.</p>
<p>The Freiherrinn sat by the chimney, rocking herself to and
fro, and holding consultation with Hatto.&nbsp; She started as
she saw Christina approaching, and made a gesture of repulsion;
but, with the feeling of being past all terror in this desolate
moment, Christina stepped nearer, knelt, and, clasping her hands,
said, &ldquo;Your pardon, lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; returned the harsh voice, even harsher
for very grief, &ldquo;thou hast naught to fear, girl.&nbsp; As
things stand, thou canst not have thy deserts.&nbsp; Dost
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, lady, it was not such pardon that I meant.&nbsp; If
you would let me be a daughter to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A daughter!&nbsp; A wood-carver&rsquo;s girl to be a
daughter of Adlerstein!&rdquo; half laughed the grim
Baroness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come here, wench,&rdquo; and Christina
underwent a series of sharp searching questions on the evidences
of her marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; ended the old lady, &ldquo;since better may
not be, we must own thee for the nonce.&nbsp; Hark ye all, this
is the Frau Freiherrinn, Freiherr Eberhard&rsquo;s widow, to be
honoured as such,&rdquo; she added, raising her voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, girl, thou hast what thou didst strive for.&nbsp;
Is not that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! lady,&rdquo; said Christina, her eyes swimming in
tears, &ldquo;I would fain have striven to be a comforter, or to
weep together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! to bewitch me as thou didst my poor son and
daughter, and well-nigh my lord himself!&nbsp; Girl!&nbsp;
Girl!&nbsp; Thou know&rsquo;st I cannot burn thee now; but away
with thee; try not my patience too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, more desolate than ever, the crushed and broken-hearted
Christina, a widow before she had been owned a wife, returned to
the room that was now so full of memories as to be even more home
than Master Gottfried&rsquo;s gallery at Ulm.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PASSING THE OUBLIETTE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> can describe the dreariness of
being snowed-up all the winter with such a mother-in-law as
Freiherrinn Kunigunde?</p>
<p>Yet it was well that the snow came early, for it was the best
defence of the lonely castle from any attack on the part of the
Schlangenwaldern, the Swabian League, or the next heir, Freiherr
Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss.&nbsp; The elder Baroness had,
at least, the merit of a stout heart, and, even with her
sadly-reduced garrison, feared none of them.&nbsp; She had been
brought up in the faith that Adlerstein was impregnable, and so
she still believed; and, if the disaster that had cut off her
husband and son was to happen at all, she was glad that it had
befallen before the homage had been paid.&nbsp; Probably the
Schlangenwald Count knew how tough a morsel the castle was like
to prove, and Wildschloss was serving at a distance, for nothing
was heard of either during the short interval while the roads
were still open.&nbsp; During this time an attempt had been made
through Father Norbert to ascertain what had become of the
corpses of the two Barons and their followers, and it had
appeared that the Count had carried them all off from the inn, no
doubt to adorn his castle with their limbs, or to present them to
the Emperor in evidence of his zeal for order.&nbsp; The old
Baron could not indeed have been buried in consecrated ground,
nor have masses said for him; but for the weal of her son&rsquo;s
soul Dame Kunigunde gave some of her few ornaments, and Christina
added her gold earrings, and all her scanty purse, that both her
husband and father might be joined in the prayers of the
Church&mdash;trying with all her might to put confidence in Hugh
Sorel&rsquo;s Loretto relic, and the Indulgence he had bought,
and trusting with more consolatory thoughts to the ever stronger
dawnings of good she had watched in her own Eberhard.</p>
<p>She had some consoling intercourse with the priest while all
this was pending; but throughout the winter she was entirely cut
off from every creature save the inmates of the castle, where, as
far as the old lady was concerned, she only existed on
sufferance, and all her meekness and gentleness could not win for
her more than the barest toleration.</p>
<p>That Eberhard had for a few hours survived his father, and
that thus the Freiherrinn Christina was as much the Dowager
Baroness as Kunigunde herself, was often insisted on in the
kitchen by Ursel, Hatto, and the Schneiderlein, whom Christina
had unconsciously rendered her most devoted servant, not only by
her daily care of his wound, but by her kind courteous words, and
by her giving him his proper name of Heinz, dropping the absurd
<i>nom de guerre</i> of the Schneiderlein, or little tailor,
which had been originally conferred on him in allusion to the
valiant Tailorling who boasted of having killed seven flies at a
blow, and had been carried on chiefly because of the
contradiction between such a title and his huge brawny strength
and fierce courage.&nbsp; Poor Eberhard, with his undaunted
bravery and free reckless good-nature, a ruffian far more by
education than by nature, had been much loved by his
followers.&nbsp; His widow would have reaped the benefit of that
affection even if her exceeding sweetness had not gained it on
her own account; and this giant was completely gained over to
her, when, amid all her sorrow and feebleness, she never failed
to minister to his sufferings to the utmost, while her questions
about his original home, and revival of the name of his
childhood, softened him, and awoke in him better feelings.&nbsp;
He would have died to serve her, and she might have headed an
opposition party in the castle, had she not been quite
indifferent to all save her grief; and, except by sitting above
the salt at the empty table, she laid no claim to any honours or
authority, and was more seldom than ever seen beyond what was now
called her own room.</p>
<p>At last, when for the second time she was seeing the snow
wreaths dwindle, and the drops shine forth in moisture again,
while the mountain paths were set free by the might of the
springtide sun, she spoke almost for the first time with
authority, as she desired Heinz to saddle her mule, and escort
her to join in the Easter mass at the Blessed Friedmund&rsquo;s
Chapel.&nbsp; Ursel heaped up objections; but so urgent was
Christina for confession and for mass, that the old woman had not
the heart to stop her by a warning to the elder Baroness, and
took the alternative of accompanying her.&nbsp; It was a glorious
sparkling Easter Day, lovely blue sky above, herbage and flowers
glistening below, snow dazzling in the hollows, peasants
assembling in holiday garb, and all rejoicing.&nbsp; Even the
lonely widow, in her heavy veil and black mufflings, took hope
back to her heart, and smiled when at the church door a little
child came timidly up to her with a madder-tinted Easter
egg&mdash;a gift once again like the happy home customs of
Ulm.&nbsp; She gave the child a kiss&mdash;she had nothing else
to give, but the sweet face sent it away strangely glad.</p>
<p>The festival mass in all its exultation was not fully over,
when anxious faces began to be seen at the door, and whisperings
went round and many passed out.&nbsp; Nobody at Adlerstein was
particular about silence in church, and, when the service was not
in progress, voices were not even lowered, and, after many
attempts on the part of the Schneiderlein to attract the
attention of his mistress, his voice immediately succeeded the
<i>Ite missa est</i>, &ldquo;Gracious lady, we must begone.&nbsp;
Your mule is ready.&nbsp; There is a party at the Debateable
Ford, whether Schlangenwald or Wildschloss we know not yet, but
either way you must be the first thing placed in
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina turned deadly pale.&nbsp; She had long been ready to
welcome death as a peaceful friend; but, sheltered as her
girlhood had been in the quiet city, she had never been brought
in contact with warfare, and her nervous, timid temperament made
the thought most appalling and frightful to her, certain as she
was that the old Baroness would resist to the uttermost.&nbsp;
Father Norbert saw her extreme terror, and, with the thought that
he might comfort and support her, perhaps mediate between the
contending parties, plead that it was holy-tide, and proclaim the
peace of the church, or at the worst protect the lady herself, he
offered his company; but, though she thanked him, it was as if
she scarcely understood his kindness, and a shudder passed over
her whenever the serfs, hastily summoned to augment the garrison,
came hurrying down the path, or turned aside into the more rugged
and shorter descents.&nbsp; It was strange, the good father
thought, that so timorous and fragile a being should have her lot
cast amid these rugged places and scenes of violence, with no one
to give her the care and cherishing she so much required.</p>
<p>Even when she crept up the castle stairs, she was met with an
angry rebuke, not so much for the peril she had incurred as for
having taken away the Schneiderlein, by far the most availing
among the scanty remnant of the retainers of Adlerstein.&nbsp;
Attempting no answer, and not even daring to ask from what
quarter came the alarm, Christina made her way out of the turmoil
to that chamber of her own, the scene of so much fear and sorrow,
and yet of some share of peace and happiness.&nbsp; But from the
window, near the fast subsiding waters of the Debateable Ford,
could plainly be seen the small troop of warriors, of whom Jobst
the Kohler had brought immediate intelligence.&nbsp; The sun
glistened on their armour, and a banner floated gaily on the
wind; but they were a fearful sight to the inmates of the lonely
castle.</p>
<p>A stout heart was however Kunigunde&rsquo;s best endowment;
and, with the steadiness and precision of a general, her commands
rang out, as she arranged and armed her garrison, perfectly
resolved against any submission, and confident in the strength of
her castle; nay, not without a hope of revenge either against
Schlangenwald or Wildschloss, whom, as a degenerate Adlerstein,
she hated only less than the slayer of her husband and son.</p>
<p>The afternoon of Easter Day however passed away without any
movement on the part of the enemy, and it was not till the
following day that they could be seen struggling through the
ford, and preparing to ascend the mountain.&nbsp; Attacks had
sometimes been disconcerted by posting men in the most dangerous
passes; but, in the lack of numbers, and of trustworthy
commanders, the Freiherrinn had judged it wiser to trust entirely
to her walls, and keep her whole force within them.</p>
<p>The new comers could hardly have had any hostile intentions,
for, though well armed and accoutred, their numbers did not
exceed twenty-five.&nbsp; The banner borne at their head was an
azure one, with a white eagle, and their leader could be observed
looking with amazement at the top of the watch-tower, where the
same eagle had that morning been hoisted for the first time since
the fall of the two Freiherren.</p>
<p>So soon as the ascent had been made, the leader wound his
horn, and, before the echoes had died away among the hills,
Hatto, acting as seneschal, was demanding his purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss,&rdquo; was the
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have hitherto been hindered by stress of
weather from coming to take possession of my inheritance.&nbsp;
Admit me, that I may arrange with the widowed Frau Freiherrinn as
to her dower and residence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The widowed Frau Freiherrinn, born of
Adlerstein,&rdquo; returned Hatto, &ldquo;thanks the Freiherr von
Adlerstein Wildschloss; but she holds the castle as guardian to
the present head of the family, the Freiherr von
Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false, old man,&rdquo; exclaimed the Wildschloss;
&ldquo;the Freiherr had no other son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hatto, &ldquo;but Freiherr Eberhard
hath left us twin heirs, our young lords, for whom we hold this
castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This trifling will not serve!&rdquo; sternly spoke the
knight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eberhard von Adlerstein died
unmarried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; returned Hatto, &ldquo;our gracious Frau
Freiherrinn, the younger, was wedded to him at the last Friedmund
Wake, by the special blessing of our good patron, who would not
see our house extinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see thy lady, old man,&rdquo; said Sir Kasimir,
impatiently, not in the least crediting the story, and believing
his cousin Kunigunde quite capable of any measure that could
preserve to her the rule in Schloss Adlerstein, even to erecting
some passing love affair of her son&rsquo;s into a
marriage.&nbsp; And he hardly did her injustice, for she had
never made any inquiry beyond the castle into the validity of
Christina&rsquo;s espousals, nor sought after the friar who had
performed the ceremony.&nbsp; She consented to an interview with
the claimant of the inheritance, and descended to the gateway for
the purpose.&nbsp; The court was at its cleanest, the thawing
snow having newly washed away its impurities, and her proud
figure, under her black hood and veil, made an imposing
appearance as she stood tall and defiant in the archway.</p>
<p>Sir Kasimir was a handsome man of about thirty, of partly
Polish descent, and endowed with Slavonic grace and courtesy, and
he had likewise been employed in negotiations with Burgundy, and
had acquired much polish and knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I regret to disturb and
intrude on a mourning family, but I am much amazed at the tidings
I have heard; and I must pray of you to confirm them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they would confound you,&rdquo; composedly
replied Kunigunde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pardon me, lady, but the Diet is very nice in
requiring full proofs.&nbsp; I would be glad to learn what lady
was chosen by my deceased cousin Eberhard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady is Christina, daughter of his esquire, Hugh
Sorel, of an honourable family at Ulm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; I know who and what Sorel was!&rdquo;
exclaimed Wildschloss.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady cousin, thou wouldst not
stain the shield of Adlerstein with owning aught that cannot bear
the examination of the Diet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Kasimir,&rdquo; said Kunigunde proudly, &ldquo;had
I known the truth ere my son&rsquo;s death, I had strangled the
girl with mine own hands!&nbsp; But I learnt it only by his dying
confession; and, had she been a beggar&rsquo;s child, she was his
wedded wife, and her babes are his lawful heirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowest thou time&mdash;place&mdash;witnesses?&rdquo;
inquired Sir Kasimir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time, the Friedmund Wake; the place, the Friedmund
Chapel,&rdquo; replied the Baroness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come hither,
Schneiderlein.&nbsp; Tell the knight thy young lord&rsquo;s
confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bore emphatic testimony to poor Eberhard&rsquo;s last
words; but as to the point of who had performed the ceremony, he
knew not,&mdash;his mind had not retained the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see the Frau herself,&rdquo; said Wildschloss,
feeling certain that such a being as he expected in a daughter of
the dissolute lanzknecht Sorel would soon, by dexterous
questioning, be made to expose the futility of her pretensions so
flagrantly that even Kunigunde could not attempt to maintain
them.</p>
<p>For one moment Kunigunde hesitated, but suddenly a look of
malignant satisfaction crossed her face.&nbsp; She spoke a few
words to Squinting M&auml;tz, and then replied that Sir Kasimir
should be allowed to satisfy himself, but that she could admit no
one else into the castle; hers was a widow&rsquo;s household, the
twins were only a few hours old, and she could not open her gates
to admit any person besides himself.</p>
<p>So resolved on judging for himself was Adlerstein Wildschloss
that all this did not stagger him; for, even if he had believed
more than he did of the old lady&rsquo;s story, there would have
been no sense of intrusion or impropriety in such a visit to the
mother.&nbsp; Indeed, had Christina been living in the civilized
world, her chamber would have been hung with black cloth, black
velvet would have enveloped her up to the eyes, and the blackest
of cradles would have stood ready for her fatherless babe; two
steps, in honour of her baronial rank, would have led to her bed,
and a beaufet with the due baronial amount of gold and silver
plate would have held the comfits and caudle to be dispensed to
all visitors.&nbsp; As it was, the two steps built into the floor
of the room, and the black hood that Ursel tied over her young
mistress&rsquo;s head, were the only traces that such etiquette
had ever been heard of.</p>
<p>But when Baron Kasimir had clanked up the turret stairs, each
step bringing to her many a memory of him who should have been
there, and when he had been led to the bedside, he was completely
taken by surprise.</p>
<p>Instead of the great, flat-faced, coarse comeliness of a
German wench, treated as a lady in order to deceive him, he saw a
delicate, lily-like face, white as ivory, and the soft, sweet
brown eyes under their drooping lashes, so full of innocence and
sad though thankful content, that he felt as if the inquiries he
came to make were almost sacrilege.</p>
<p>He had seen enough of the world to know that no agent in a
clumsy imposition would look like this pure white creature, with
her arm encircling the two little swaddled babes, whose red faces
and bald heads alone were allowed to appear above their
mummy-like wrappings; and he could only make an obeisance lower
and infinitely more respectful than that with which he had
favoured the Baroness <i>n&eacute;e</i> von Adlerstein, with a
few words of inquiry and apology.</p>
<p>But Christina had her sons&rsquo; rights to defend now, and
she had far more spirit to do so than ever she had had in
securing her own position, and a delicate rose tint came into her
cheek as she said in her soft voice, &ldquo;The Baroness tells
me, that you, noble sir, would learn who wedded me to my dear and
blessed lord, Sir Eberhard.&nbsp; It was Friar Peter of the
Franciscan brotherhood of Offingen, an agent for selling
indulgences.&nbsp; Two of his lay brethren were present.&nbsp; My
dear lord gave his own name and mine in full after the holy rite;
the friar promising his testimony if it were needed.&nbsp; He is
to be found, or at least heard of, at his own cloister; and the
hermit at the chapel likewise beheld a part of the
ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, enough, lady,&rdquo; replied Sir Kasimir;
&ldquo;forgive me for having forced the question upon
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Christina, with her blush
deepening, &ldquo;it is but just and due to us all;&rdquo; and
her soft eyes had a gleam of exultation, as she looked at the two
little mummies that made up the <i>us</i>&mdash;&ldquo;I would
have all inquiries made in full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall be made, lady, as will be needful for the
establishment of your son&rsquo;s right as a free Baron of the
empire, but not with any doubt on my part, or desire to
controvert that right.&nbsp; I am fully convinced, and only wish
to serve you and my little cousins.&nbsp; Which of them is the
head of our family?&rdquo; he added, looking at the two
absolutely undistinguishable little chrysalises, so exactly alike
that Christina herself was obliged to look for the black ribbon,
on which a medal had been hung, round the neck of the
elder.&nbsp; Sir Kasimir put one knee to the ground as he kissed
the red cheek of the infant and the white hand of the mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady cousin,&rdquo; he said to Kunigunde, who had stood
by all this time with an anxious, uneasy, scowling expression on
her face, &ldquo;I am satisfied.&nbsp; I own this babe as the
true Freiherr von Adlerstein, and far be it from me to trouble
his heritage.&nbsp; Rather point out the way in which I may serve
you and him.&nbsp; Shall I represent all to the Emperor, and
obtain his wardship, so as to be able to protect you from any
attacks by the enemies of the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, sir,&rdquo; returned the elder lady, severely,
seeing Christina&rsquo;s gratified, imploring face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The right line of Adlerstein can take care of itself
without greedy guardians appointed by usurpers.&nbsp; Our
submission has never been made, and the Emperor cannot dispose of
our wardship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kunigunde looked defiant, regarding herself and her
grandson as quite as good as the Emperor, and ready to blast her
daughter-in-law with her eyes for murmuring gratefully and
wistfully, &ldquo;Thanks, noble sir, thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me at least win a friendly right in my young
cousins,&rdquo; said Sir Kasimir, the more drawn by pitying
admiration towards their mother, as he perceived more of the
grandmother&rsquo;s haughty repulsiveness and want of
comprehension of the dangers of her position.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
are not baptized?&nbsp; Let me become their godfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina&rsquo;s face was all joy and gratitude, and even the
grandmother made no objection; in fact, it was the babes&rsquo;
only chance of a noble sponsor; and Father Norbert, who had
already been making ready for the baptism, was sent for from the
hall.&nbsp; Kunigunde, meantime, moved about restlessly, went
half-way down the stairs, and held council with some one there;
Ursel likewise, bustled about, and Sir Kasimir remained seated on
the chair that had been placed for him near Christina&rsquo;s
bed.</p>
<p>She was able again to thank him, and add, &ldquo;It may be
that you will have more cause than the lady grandmother thinks to
remember your offer of protection to my poor orphans.&nbsp; Their
father and grandfather were, in very deed, on their way to make
submission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well known to me,&rdquo; said Sir
Kasimir.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady, I will do all in my power for
you.&nbsp; The Emperor shall hear the state of things; and, while
no violence is offered to travellers,&rdquo; he added, lowering
his tone, &ldquo;I doubt not he will wait for full submission
till this young Baron be of age to tender it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are scarce in force to offer violence,&rdquo; said
Christina sighing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no power to withstand the
Lady Baroness.&nbsp; I am like a stranger here; but, oh! sir, if
the Emperor and Diet will be patient and forbearing with this
desolate house, my babes, if they live, shall strive to requite
their mercy by loyalty.&nbsp; And the blessing of the widow and
fatherless will fall on you, most generous knight,&rdquo; she
added, fervently, holding out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would I could do more for you,&rdquo; said the
knight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ask, and all I can do is at your
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; cried Christina, her eyes brightening,
&ldquo;there is one most inestimable service you could render
me&mdash;to let my uncle, Master Gottfried, the wood-carver of
Ulm, know where I am, and of my state, and of my
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Kasimir repeated the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was my home,
there was I brought up by my dear uncle and aunt, till my father
bore me away to attend on the young lady here.&nbsp; It is
eighteen months since they had any tidings from her who was as a
daughter to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see them myself,&rdquo; said Kasimir; &ldquo;I
know the name.&nbsp; Carved not Master Gottfried the stall-work
at Augsburg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&nbsp; In chestnut leaves!&nbsp; And the
Misereres all with fairy tales!&rdquo; exclaimed Christina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, sir, thanks indeed!&nbsp; Bear to the dear, dear uncle
and aunt their child&rsquo;s duteous greetings, and tell them she
loves them with all her heart, and prays them to forgive her, and
to pray for her and her little ones!&nbsp; And,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;my uncle may not have learnt how his brother, my father,
died by his lord&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Oh! pray him, if ever he
loved his little Christina, to have masses sung for my father and
my own dear lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she promised, Ursel came to make the babes ready for their
baptism, and Sir Kasimir moved away towards the window.&nbsp;
Ursel was looking uneasy and dismayed, and, as she bent over her
mistress, she whispered, &ldquo;Lady, the Schneiderlein sends you
word that M&auml;tz has called him to help in removing the props
of the door you wot of when <i>he</i> yonder steps across
it.&nbsp; He would know if it be your will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The oubliette!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was Frau
Kunigunde&rsquo;s usage of the relative who was doing his best
for the welfare of her grandsons!&nbsp; Christina&rsquo;s whole
countenance looked so frozen with horror, that Ursel felt as if
she had killed her on the spot; but the next moment a flash of
relief came over the pale features, and the trembling lip
commanded itself to say, &ldquo;My best thanks to good
Heinz.&nbsp; Say to him that I forbid it.&nbsp; If he loves the
life of his master&rsquo;s children, he will abstain!&nbsp; Tell
him so.&nbsp; My blessings on him if this knight leave the castle
safe, Ursel.&rdquo; And her terrified earnest eyes impelled Ursel
to hasten to do her bidding; but whether it had been executed,
there was no knowing, for almost immediately the Freiherrinn and
Father Norbert entered, and Ursel returned with them.&nbsp; Nay,
the message given, who could tell if Heinz would be able to act
upon it?&nbsp; In the ordinary condition of the castle, he was
indeed its most efficient inmate; M&auml;tz did not approach him
in strength, Hans was a cripple, Hatto would be on the right
side; but Jobst the Kohler, and the other serfs who had been
called in for the defence, were more likely to hold with the
elder than the younger lady.&nbsp; And Frau Kunigunde herself,
knowing well that the five-and-twenty men outside would be
incompetent to avenge their master, confident in her
narrow-minded, ignorant pride that no one could take Schloss
Adlerstein, and incapable of understanding the changes in society
that were rendering her isolated condition untenable, was certain
to scout any representation of the dire consequences that the
crime would entail.&nbsp; Kasimir had no near kindred, and
private revenge was the only justice the Baroness believed in;
she only saw in her crime the satisfaction of an old feud, and
the union of the Wildschloss property with the parent stem.</p>
<p>Seldom could such a christening have taken place as that of
which Christina&rsquo;s bed-room was the scene&mdash;the mother
scarcely able even to think of the holy sacrament for the horror
of knowing that the one sponsor was already exulting in the
speedy destruction of the other; and, poor little feeble thing,
rallying the last remnants of her severely-tried powers to
prevent the crime at the most terrible of risks.</p>
<p>The elder babe received from his grandmother the hereditary
name of Eberhard, but Sir Kasimir looked at the mother
inquiringly, ere he gave the other to the priest.&nbsp; Christina
had well-nigh said, &ldquo;Oubliette,&rdquo; but, recalling
herself in time, she feebly uttered the name she had longed after
from the moment she had known that two sons had been her Easter
gift, &ldquo;Gottfried,&rdquo; after her beloved uncle.&nbsp; But
Kunigunde caught the sound, and exclaimed, &ldquo;No son of
Adlerstein shall bear abase craftsman&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; Call
him R&auml;cher (the avenger);&rdquo; and in the word there
already rang a note of victory and revenge that made
Christina&rsquo;s blood run cold.&nbsp; Sir Kasimir marked her
trouble.&nbsp; &ldquo;The lady mother loves not the sound,&rdquo;
he said, kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady, have you any other
wish?&nbsp; Then will I call him Friedmund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina had almost smiled.&nbsp; To her the omen was of the
best.&nbsp; Baron Friedmund had been the last common ancestor of
the two branches of the family, the patron saint was so called,
his wake was her wedding-day, the sound of the word imported
peace, and the good Barons Ebbo and Friedel had ever been linked
together lovingly by popular memory.&nbsp; And so the second
little Baron received the name of Friedmund, and then the knight
of Wildschloss, perceiving, with consideration rare in a warrior,
that the mother looked worn out and feverish, at once prepared to
kiss her hand and take leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more favour, Sir Knight,&rdquo; she said, lifting
up her head, while a burning spot rose on either cheek.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I beg of you to take my two babes down&mdash;yes, both,
both, in your own arms, and show them to your men, owning them as
your kinsmen and godsons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Kasimir looked exceedingly amazed, as if he thought the
lady&rsquo;s senses taking leave of her, and Dame Kunigunde broke
out into declarations that it was absurd, and she did not know
what she was talking of; but she repeated almost with passion,
&ldquo;Take them, take them, you know not how much depends on
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ursel, with unusual readiness of wit, signed and
whispered that the young mother must be humoured, for fear of
consequences; till the knight, in a good-natured, confused way,
submitted to receive the two little bundles in his arms, while he
gave place to Kunigunde, who hastily stepped before him in a
manner that made Christina trust that her precaution would be
effectual.</p>
<p>The room was reeling round with her.&nbsp; The agony of those
few minutes was beyond all things unspeakable.&nbsp; What had
seemed just before like a certain way of saving the guest without
real danger to her children, now appeared instead the most
certain destruction to all, and herself the unnatural mother who
had doomed her new-born babes for a stranger&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp;
She could not even pray; she would have shrieked to have them
brought back, but her voice was dead within her, her tongue clave
to the roof of her mouth, ringings in her ears hindered her even
from listening to the descending steps.&nbsp; She lay as one
dead, when ten minutes afterwards the cry of one of her babes
struck on her ear, and the next moment Ursel stood beside her,
laying them down close to her, and saying exultingly,
&ldquo;Safe! safe out at the gate, and down the hillside, and my
old lady ready to gnaw off her hands for spite!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EAGLETS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Christina&rsquo;s</span> mental and bodily
constitution had much similarity&mdash;apparently most delicate,
tender, and timid, yet capable of a vigour, health, and endurance
that withstood shocks that might have been fatal to many
apparently stronger persons.&nbsp; The events of that frightful
Easter Monday morning did indeed almost kill her; but the
effects, though severe, were not lasting; and by the time the
last of Ermentrude&rsquo;s snow-wreath had vanished, she was
sunning her babes at the window, happier than she had ever
thought to be&mdash;above all, in the possession of both the
children.&nbsp; A nurse had been captured for the little Baron
from the village on the hillside; but the woman had fretted, the
child had pined, and had been given back to his mother to save
his life; and ever since both had thriven perfectly under her
sole care, so that there was very nearly joy in that room.</p>
<p>Outside it, there was more bitterness than ever.&nbsp; The
grandmother had softened for a few moments at the birth of the
children, with satisfaction at obtaining twice as much as she had
hoped; but the frustration of her vengeance upon Kasimir of
Adlerstein Wildschloss had renewed all her hatred, and she had no
scruple in abusing &ldquo;the burgher-woman&rdquo; to the whole
household for her artful desire to captivate another
nobleman.&nbsp; She, no doubt, expected that degenerate fool of a
Wildschlosser to come wooing after her; &ldquo;if he did he
should meet his deserts.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the favourite
reproach whenever she chose to vent her fury on the mute,
blushing, weeping young widow, whose glance at her babies was her
only appeal against the cruel accusation.</p>
<p>On Midsummer eve, Heinz the Schneiderlein, who had all day
been taking toll from the various attendants at the Friedmund
Wake, came up and knocked at the door.&nbsp; He had a bundle over
his shoulder and a bag in his hand, which last he offered to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The toll!&nbsp; It is for the Lady Baroness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my Lady Baroness.&nbsp; I levy toll for this my
young lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it to her, good Heinz, she must have the charge,
and needless strife I will not breed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The angry notes of Dame Kunigunde came up: &ldquo;How now,
knave Schneiderlein!&nbsp; Come down with the toll
instantly.&nbsp; It shall not be tampered with!&nbsp; Down, I
say, thou thief of a tailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go; prithee go, vex her not,&rdquo; entreated
Christina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, lady!&rdquo; shouted Heinz, and, disregarding
all further objurgations from beneath, he proceeded to deposit
his bundle, and explain that it had been entrusted to him by a
pedlar from Ulm, who would likewise take charge of anything she
might have to send in return, and he then ran down just in time
to prevent a domiciliary visit from the old lady.</p>
<p>From Ulm!&nbsp; The very sound was joy; and Christina with
trembling hands unfastened the cords and stitches that secured
the canvas covering, within which lay folds on folds of linen,
and in the midst a rich silver goblet, long ago brought by her
father from Italy, a few of her own possessions, and a letter
from her uncle secured with black floss silk, with a black
seal.</p>
<p>She kissed it with transport, but the contents were somewhat
chilling by their grave formality.&nbsp; The opening address to
the &ldquo;honour-worthy Lady Baroness and love-worthy
niece,&rdquo; conveyed to her a doubt on good Master
Gottfried&rsquo;s part whether she were still truly worthy of
love or honour.&nbsp; The slaughter at Jacob M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
had been already known to him, and he expressed himself as
relieved, but greatly amazed, at the information he had received
from the Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss, who had visited him at
Ulm, after having verified what had been alleged at Schloss
Adlerstein by application to the friar at Offingen.</p>
<p>Freiherr von Adlerstein Wildschloss had further requested him
to make known that, feud-briefs having regularly passed between
Schlangenwald and Adlerstein, and the two Barons not having been
within the peace of the empire, no justice could be exacted for
their deaths; yet, in consideration of the tender age of the
present heirs, the question of forfeiture or submission should be
waived till they could act for themselves, and Schlangenwald
should be withheld from injuring them so long as no molestation
was offered to travellers.&nbsp; It was plain that Sir Kasimir
had well and generously done his best to protect the helpless
twins, and he sent respectful but cordial greetings to their
mother.&nbsp; These however were far less heeded by her than the
coldness of her uncle&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; She had drifted
beyond the reckoning of her kindred, and they were sending her
her property and bridal linen, as if they had done with her, and
had lost their child in the robber-baron&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Yet
at the end there was a touch of old times in offering a blessing,
should she still value it, and the hopes that heaven and the
saints would comfort her; &ldquo;for surely, thou poor child,
thou must have suffered much, and, if thou wiliest still to write
to thy city kin, thine aunt would rejoice to hear that thou and
thy babes were in good health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Precise grammarian and scribe as was Uncle Gottfried, the
lapse from the formal <i>Sie</i> to the familiar <i>Du</i> went
to his niece&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Whenever her little ones left
her any leisure, she spent this her first wedding-day in writing
so earnest and loving a letter as, in spite of medi&aelig;val
formality, must assure the good burgomaster that, except in
having suffered much and loved much, his little Christina was not
changed since she had left him.</p>
<p>No answer could be looked for till another wake-day; but, when
it came, it was full and loving, and therewith were sent a few
more of her favourite books, a girdle, and a richly-scented pair
of gloves, together with two ivory boxes of comfits, and two
little purple silk, gold-edged, straight, narrow garments and
tight round brimless lace caps, for the two little Barons.&nbsp;
Nor did henceforth a wake-day pass by without bringing some such
token, not only delightful as gratifying Christina&rsquo;s
affection by the kindness that suggested them, but supplying
absolute wants in the dire stress of poverty at Schloss
Adlerstein.</p>
<p>Christina durst not tell her mother-in-law of the terms on
which they were unmolested, trusting to the scantiness of the
retinue, and to her own influence with the Schneiderlein to
hinder any serious violence.&nbsp; Indeed, while the Count of
Schlangenwald was in the neighbourhood, his followers took care
to secure all that could be captured at the Debateable Ford, and
the broken forces of Adlerstein would have been insane had they
attempted to contend with such superior numbers.&nbsp; That the
castle remained unattacked was attributed by the elder Baroness
to its own merits; nor did Christina undeceive her.&nbsp; They
had no intercourse with the outer world, except that once a
pursuivant arrived with a formal intimation from their kinsman,
the Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss, of his marriage with the
noble Fr&auml;ulein, Countess Valeska von Trautbach, and a
present of a gay dagger for each of his godsons.&nbsp; Frau
Kunigunde triumphed a good deal over the notion of
Christina&rsquo;s supposed disappointment; but the tidings were
most welcome to the younger lady, who trusted they would put an
end to all future taunts about Wildschloss.&nbsp; Alas! the
handle for abuse was too valuable to be relinquished.</p>
<p>The last silver cup the castle had possessed had to be given
as a reward to the pursuivant, and mayhap Frau Kunigunde reckoned
this as another offence of her daughter-in-law, since, had Sir
Kasimir been safe in the oubliette, the twins might have shared
his broad lands on the Danube, instead of contributing to the
fees of his pursuivant.&nbsp; The cup could indeed be ill
spared.&nbsp; The cattle and swine, the dues of the serfs, and
the yearly toll at the wake were the sole resources of the
household; and though there was no lack of meat, milk, and black
bread, sufficient garments could scarce be come by, with all the
spinning of the household, woven by the village webster, of whose
time the baronial household, by prescriptive right, owned the
lion&rsquo;s share.</p>
<p>These matters little troubled the two beings in whom
Christina&rsquo;s heart was wrapped up.&nbsp; Though running
about barefooted and bareheaded, they were healthy, handsome,
straight-limbed, noble-looking creatures, so exactly alike, and
so inseparable, that no one except herself could tell one from
the other save by the medal of Our Lady worn by the elder, and
the little cross carved by the mother for the younger; indeed, at
one time, the urchins themselves would feel for cross or medal,
ere naming themselves &ldquo;Ebbo,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Friedel.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were tall for their age, but
with the slender make of their foreign ancestry; and, though
their fair rosy complexions were brightened by mountain mists and
winds, their rapidly darkening hair, and large liquid brown eyes,
told of their Italian blood.&nbsp; Their grandmother looked on
their colouring as a taint, and Christina herself had hoped to
see their father&rsquo;s simple, kindly blue eyes revive in his
boys; but she could hardly have desired anything different from
the dancing, kindling, or earnest glances that used to flash from
under their long black lashes when they were nestling in her lap,
or playing by her knee, making music with their prattle, or
listening to her answers with faces alive with
intelligence.&nbsp; They scarcely left her time for sorrow or
regret.</p>
<p>They were never quarrelsome.&nbsp; Either from the influence
of her gentleness, or from their absolute union, they could do
and enjoy nothing apart, and would as soon have thought of their
right and left hands falling out as of Ebbo and Friedel
disputing.&nbsp; Ebbo however was always the right hand.&nbsp;
<i>The</i> Freiherr, as he had been called from the first, had,
from the time he could sit at the table at all, been put into the
baronial chair with the eagle carved at the back; every member of
the household, from his grandmother downwards, placed him
foremost, and Friedel followed their example, at the less loss to
himself, as his hand was always in Ebbo&rsquo;s, and all their
doings were in common.&nbsp; Sometimes however the mother doubted
whether there would have been this perfect absence of all contest
had the medal of the firstborn chanced to hang round
Friedmund&rsquo;s neck instead of Eberhard&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At
first they were entirely left to her.&nbsp; Their grandmother
heeded them little as long as they were healthy, and evidently
regarded them more as heirs of Adlerstein than as grandchildren;
but, as they grew older, she showed anxiety lest their mother
should interfere with the fierce, lawless spirit proper to their
line.</p>
<p>One winter day, when they were nearly six years old,
Christina, spinning at her window, had been watching them
snowballing in the castle court, smiling and applauding every
large handful held up to her, every laughing combat, every
well-aimed hit, as the hardy little fellows scattered the snow in
showers round them, raising their merry fur-capped faces to the
bright eyes that &ldquo;rained influence and judged the
prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By and by they stood still; Ebbo&mdash;she knew him by the
tossed head and commanding air&mdash;was proposing what Friedel
seemed to disapprove; but, after a short discussion, Ebbo flung
away from him, and went towards a shed where was kept a wolf-cub,
recently presented to the young Barons by old Ulrich&rsquo;s
son.&nbsp; The whelp was so young as to be quite harmless, but it
was far from amiable; Friedel never willingly approached it, and
the snarling and whining replies to all advances had begun to
weary and irritate Ebbo.&nbsp; He dragged it out by its chain,
and, tethering it to a post, made it a mark for his snowballs,
which, kneaded hard, and delivered with hearty good-will by his
sturdy arms, made the poor little beast yelp with pain and
terror, till the more tender-hearted Friedel threw himself on his
brother to withhold him, while M&auml;tz stood by laughing and
applauding the Baron.&nbsp; Seeing Ebbo shake Friedel off with
unusual petulance, and pitying the tormented animal, Christina
flung a cloak round her head and hastened down stairs, entering
the court just as the terrified whelp had made a snap at the boy,
which was returned by angry, vindictive pelting, not merely with
snow, but with stones.&nbsp; Friedel sprang to her crying, and
her call to Ebbo made him turn, though with fury in his face,
shouting, &ldquo;He would bite me! the evil beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, Ebbo,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall suffer for it, the spiteful, ungrateful
brute!&nbsp; Let me alone, mother!&rdquo; cried Ebbo, stamping on
the snow, but still from habit yielding to her hand on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; demanded the old Baroness, appearing
on the scene.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is thwarting the Baron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She; she will not let me deal with yonder savage
whelp,&rdquo; cried the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She!&nbsp; Take thy way, child,&rdquo; said the old
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Visit him well for his malice.&nbsp; None
shall withstand thee here.&nbsp; At thy peril!&rdquo; she added,
turning on Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, art not content to have
brought base mechanical blood into a noble house?&nbsp; Wouldst
make slaves and cowards of its sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would teach them true courage, not cruelty,&rdquo;
she tried to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should such as thou know of courage?&nbsp; Look
here, girl: another word to daunt the spirit of my grandsons, and
I&rsquo;ll have thee scourged down the mountain-side!&nbsp;
On!&nbsp; At him, Ebbo!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my gallant young
knight!&nbsp; Out of the way, girl, with thy whining looks!&nbsp;
What, Friedel, be a man, and aid thy brother!&nbsp; Has she made
thee a puling woman already?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Kunigunde laid an
ungentle grasp upon Friedmund, who was clinging to his mother,
hiding his face in her gown.&nbsp; He struggled against the
clutch, and would not look up or be detached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie, poor little coward!&rdquo; taunted the old lady;
&ldquo;never heed him, Ebbo, my brave Baron!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cut to the heart, Christina took refuge in her room, and
gathered her Friedel to her bosom, as he sobbed out, &ldquo;Oh,
mother, the poor little wolf!&nbsp; Oh, mother, are you weeping
too?&nbsp; The grandmother should not so speak to the sweetest,
dearest motherling,&rdquo; he added, throwing his arms round her
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Friedel, that Ebbo should learn that it is brave
to hurt the weak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not like Walther of V&ouml;gelwiede,&rdquo; said
Friedel, whose mind had been much impressed by the
Minnesinger&rsquo;s bequest to the birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor like any true Christian knight.&nbsp; Alas, my poor
boys, must you be taught foul cruelty and I too weak and cowardly
to save you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That never will be,&rdquo; said Friedel, lifting his
head from her shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hark! what a howl was
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen not, dear child; it does but pain
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Ebbo is not shouting.&nbsp; Oh, mother, he is
vexed&mdash;he is hurt!&rdquo; cried Friedel, springing from her
lap; but, ere either could reach the window, Ebbo had vanished
from the scene.&nbsp; They only saw the young wolf stretched dead
on the snow, and the same moment in burst Ebbo, and flung himself
on the floor in a passion of weeping.&nbsp; Stimulated by the
applause of his grandmother and of M&auml;tz, he had furiously
pelted the poor animal with all missiles that came to hand, till
a blow, either from him or M&auml;tz, had produced such a howl
and struggle of agony, and then such terrible stillness, as had
gone to the young Baron&rsquo;s very heart, a heart as soft as
that of his father had been by nature.&nbsp; Indeed, his sobs
were so piteous that his mother was relieved to hear only,
&ldquo;The wolf! the poor wolf!&rdquo; and to find that he
himself was unhurt; and she was scarcely satisfied of this when
Dame Kunigunde came up also alarmed, and thus turned his grief to
wrath.&nbsp; &ldquo;As if I would cry in that way for a
bite!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, grandame; you made me do
it, the poor beast!&rdquo; with a fresh sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulrich shall get thee another cub, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I never will have another cub!&nbsp; Why did
you let me kill it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame, Ebbo!&nbsp; Weep for a spiteful brute!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s no better than thy mother or Friedel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love my mother!&nbsp; I love Friedel!&nbsp; They
would have withheld me.&nbsp; Go, go; I hate you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, peace, Ebbo,&rdquo; exclaimed his mother;
&ldquo;you know not what you say.&nbsp; Ask your
grandmother&rsquo;s pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, thou fool!&rdquo; screamed the old lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Baron speaks as he will in his own castle.&nbsp; He is
not to be checked here, and thwarted there, and taught to mince
his words like a cap-in-hand pedlar.&nbsp; Pardon!&nbsp; When did
an Adlerstein seek pardon?&nbsp; Come with me, my Baron; I have
still some honey-cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Ebbo; &ldquo;honey-cakes will not
cure the wolf whelp.&nbsp; Go: I want my mother and
Friedel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone with them his pride and passion were gone; but alas!
what augury for the future of her boys was left with the
mother!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EAGLE&rsquo;S PREY</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> fell about
the Lammas tide,<br />
When moor men win their hay,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that all the serfs of Adlerstein were collected to collect
their lady&rsquo;s hay to be stored for the winter&rsquo;s fodder
of the goats, and of poor Sir Eberhard&rsquo;s old white mare,
the only steed as yet ridden by the young Barons.</p>
<p>The boys were fourteen years old.&nbsp; So monotonous was
their mother&rsquo;s life that it was chiefly their growth that
marked the length of her residence in the castle.&nbsp; Otherwise
there had been no change, except that the elder Baroness was more
feeble in her limbs, and still more irritable and excitable in
temper.&nbsp; There were no events, save a few hunting adventures
of the boys, or the yearly correspondence with Ulm; and the same
life continued, of shrinking in dread from the old lady&rsquo;s
tyrannous dislike, and of the constant endeavour to infuse better
principles into the boys, without the open opposition for which
there was neither power nor strength.</p>
<p>The boys&rsquo; love was entirely given to their mother.&nbsp;
Far from diminishing with their dependence on her, it increased
with the sense of protection; and, now that they were taller than
herself, she seemed to be cherished by them more than ever.&nbsp;
Moreover, she was their oracle.&nbsp; Quick-witted and
active-minded, loving books the more because their grandmother
thought signing a feud-letter the utmost literary effort becoming
to a noble, they never rested till they had acquired all that
their mother could teach them; or, rather, they then became more
restless than ever.&nbsp; Long ago had her whole store of tales
and ballads become so familiar, by repetition, that the boys
could correct her in the smallest variation; reading and writing
were mastered as for pleasure; and the Nuremberg Chronicle, with
its wonderful woodcuts, excited such a passion of curiosity that
they must needs conquer its Latin and read it for
themselves.&nbsp; This <i>World History</i>, with <i>Alexander
and the Nine Worthies</i>, the cities and landscapes, and the
oft-repeated portraits, was Eberhard&rsquo;s study; but Friedmund
continued&mdash;constant to Walther of V&ouml;gelweide.&nbsp;
Eberhard cared for no character in the Vulgate so much as for
Judas the Maccabee; but Friedmund&rsquo;s heart was all for King
David; and to both lads, shut up from companionship as they were,
every acquaintance in their books was a living being whose like
they fancied might be met beyond their mountain.&nbsp; And, when
they should go forth, like Dietrich of Berne, in search of
adventures, doughty deeds were chiefly to fall to the lot of
Ebbo&rsquo;s lance; while Friedel was to be their Minnesinger;
and indeed certain verses, that he had murmured in his
brother&rsquo;s ear, had left no doubt in Ebbo&rsquo;s mind that
the exploits would be worthily sung.</p>
<p>The soft dreamy eye was becoming Friedel&rsquo;s
characteristic, as fire and keenness distinguished his
brother&rsquo;s glance.&nbsp; When at rest, the twins could be
known apart by their expression, though in all other respects
they were as alike as ever; and let Ebbo look thoughtful or
Friedel eager and they were again undistinguishable; and indeed
they were constantly changing looks.&nbsp; Had not Friedel been
beside him, Ebbo would have been deemed a wondrous student for
his years; had not Ebbo been the standard of comparison, Friedel
would have been in high repute for spirit and enterprise and
skill as a cragsman, with the crossbow, and in all feats of arms
that the Schneiderlein could impart.&nbsp; They shared all
occupations; and it was by the merest shade that Ebbo excelled
with the weapon, and Friedel with the book or tool.&nbsp; For the
artist nature was in them, not intentionally excited by their
mother, but far too strong to be easily discouraged.&nbsp; They
had long daily gazed at Ulm in the distance, hoping to behold the
spire completed; and the illustrations in their mother&rsquo;s
books excited a strong desire to imitate them.&nbsp; The floor
had often been covered with charcoal outlines even before
Christina was persuaded to impart the rules she had learnt from
her uncle; and her carving-tools were soon seized upon.&nbsp; At
first they were used only upon knobs of sticks; but one day when
the boys, roaming on the mountain, had lost their way, and coming
to the convent had been there hospitably welcomed by Father
Norbert, they came home wild to make carvings like what they had
seen in the chapel.&nbsp; Jobst the Kohler was continually
importuned for soft wood; the fair was ransacked for knives; and
even the old Baroness could not find great fault with the
occupation, base and mechanical though it were, which disposed of
the two restless spirits during the many hours when winter storms
confined them to the castle.&nbsp; Rude as was their work, the
constant observation and choice of subjects were an unsuspected
training and softening.&nbsp; It was not in vain that they lived
in the glorious mountain fastness, and saw the sun descend in his
majesty, dyeing the masses of rock with purple and crimson; not
in vain that they beheld peak and ravine clothed in purest snow,
flushed with rosy light at morn and eve, or contrasted with the
purple blue of the sky; or that they stood marvelling at ice
caverns with gigantic crystal pendants shining with the most
magical pure depths of sapphire and emerald, &ldquo;as if,&rdquo;
said Friedel, &ldquo;winter kept in his service all the
jewel-forging dwarfs of the motherling&rsquo;s tales.&rdquo; And,
when the snow melted and the buds returned, the ivy spray, the
smiling saxifrage, the purple gentian bell, the feathery rowan
leaf, the symmetrical lady&rsquo;s mantle, were hailed and loved
first as models, then for themselves.</p>
<p>One regret their mother had, almost amounting to shame.&nbsp;
Every virtuous person believed in the efficacy of the rod, and,
maugre her own docility, she had been chastised with it almost as
a religious duty; but her sons had never felt the weight of a
blow, except once when their grandmother caught them carving a
border of eagles and doves round the hall table, and then Ebbo
had returned the blow with all his might.&nbsp; As to herself, if
she ever worked herself up to attempt chastisement, the Baroness
was sure to fall upon her for insulting the noble birth of her
sons, and thus gave them a triumph far worse for them than
impunity.&nbsp; In truth, the boys had their own way, or rather
the Baron had his way, and his way was Baron
Friedmund&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Poor, bare, and scanty as were all the
surroundings of their life, everything was done to feed their
arrogance, with only one influence to counteract their education
in pride and violence&mdash;a mother&rsquo;s influence, indeed,
but her authority was studiously taken from her, and her position
set at naught, with no power save what she might derive from
their love and involuntary honour, and the sight of the pain
caused her by their wrong-doings.</p>
<p>And so the summer&rsquo;s hay-harvest was come.&nbsp; Peasants
clambered into the green nooks between the rocks to cut down with
hook or knife the flowery grass, for there was no space for the
sweep of a scythe.&nbsp; The best crop was on the bank of the
Braunwasser, by the Debateable Ford, but this was cut and carried
on the backs of the serfs, much earlier than the mountain grass,
and never without much vigilance against the Schlangenwaldern;
but this year the Count was absent at his Styrian castle, and
little had been seen or heard of his people.</p>
<p>The full muster of serfs appeared, for Frau Kunigunde admitted
of no excuses, and the sole absentee was a widow who lived on the
ledge of the mountain next above that on which the castle
stood.&nbsp; Her son reported her to be very ill, and with tears
in his eyes entreated Baron Friedel to obtain leave for him to
return to her, since she was quite alone in her solitary hut,
with no one even to give her a drink of water.&nbsp; Friedel
rushed with the entreaty to his grandmother, but she laughed it
to scorn.&nbsp; Lazy Koppel only wanted an excuse, or, if not,
the woman was old and useless, and men could not be spared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! good grandame,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;his
father died with ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more honour for him!&nbsp; The more he is bound to
work for us.&nbsp; Off, junker, make no loiterers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grieved and discomfited, Friedel betook himself to his mother
and brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish lad not to have come to me!&rdquo; said the
young Baron.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is he?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send him
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Christina interposed an offer to go and take
Koppel&rsquo;s place beside his mother, and her skill was so much
prized over all the mountain-side, that the alternative was
gratefully accepted, and she was escorted up the steep path by
her two boys to the hovel, where she spent the day in attendance
on the sick woman.</p>
<p>Evening came on, the patient was better, but Koppel did not
return, nor did the young Barons come to fetch their mother
home.&nbsp; The last sunbeams were dying off the mountain-tops,
and, beginning to suspect something amiss, she at length set off,
and half way down met Koppel, who replied to her question,
&ldquo;Ah, then, the gracious lady has not heard of our
luck.&nbsp; Excellent booty, and two prisoners!&nbsp; The young
Baron has been a hero indeed, and has won himself a knightly
steed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, on her further interrogation, he added,
that an unusually rich but small company had been reported by
Jobst the Kohler to be on the way to the ford, where he had
skilfully prepared a stumbling-block.&nbsp; The gracious Baroness
had caused Hatto to jodel all the hay-makers together, and they
had fallen on the travellers by the straight path down the
crag.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ach! did not the young Baron spring like a
young gemsbock?&nbsp; And in midstream down came their
pack-horses and their wares!&nbsp; Some of them took to flight,
but, pfui, there were enough for my young lord to show his mettle
upon.&nbsp; Such a prize the saints have not sent since the old
Baron&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina pursued her walk in dismay at this new beginning of
freebooting in its worst form, overthrowing all her hopes.&nbsp;
The best thing that could happen would be the immediate
interference of the Swabian League, while her sons were too young
to be personally held guilty.&nbsp; Yet this might involve ruin
and confiscation; and, apart from all consequences, she bitterly
grieved that the stain of robbery should have fallen on her
hitherto innocent sons.</p>
<p>Every peasant she met greeted her with praises of their young
lord, and, when she mounted the hall-steps, she found the floor
strewn with bales of goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; cried Ebbo, flying up to her,
&ldquo;have you heard?&nbsp; I have a horse! a spirited bay, a
knightly charger, and Friedel is to ride him by turns with
me.&nbsp; Where is Friedel?&nbsp; And, mother, Heinz said I
struck as good a stroke as any of them, and I have a sword for
Friedel now.&nbsp; Why does he not come?&nbsp; And, motherling,
this is for you, a gown of velvet, a real black velvet, that will
make you fairer than our Lady at the Convent.&nbsp; Come to the
window and see it, mother dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was so joyously excited that she could hardly
withstand his delight, but she did not move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like the velvet?&rdquo; he
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;We always said that, the first prize we
won, the motherling should wear velvet.&nbsp; Do but look at
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me, my Ebbo!&rdquo; she sighed, bending to kiss
his brow.</p>
<p>He understood her at once, coloured, and spoke hastily and in
defiance.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was in the river, mother, the horses
fell; it is our right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly, Ebbo?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, mother, if Jobst <i>did</i> hide a branch in
midstream, it was no doing of mine; and the horses fell.&nbsp;
The Schlangenwaldern don&rsquo;t even wait to let them
fall.&nbsp; We cannot live, if we are to be so nice and
dainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! my son, I thought not to hear you call mercy and
honesty mere niceness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I hear?&rdquo; exclaimed Frau Kunigunde,
entering from the storeroom, where she had been disposing of some
spices, a much esteemed commodity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you chiding
and daunting this boy, as you have done with the
other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother may speak to me!&rdquo; cried Ebbo, hotly,
turning round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quench thy spirit with whining fooleries!&nbsp;
Take the Baron&rsquo;s bounty, woman, and vex him not after his
first knightly exploit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows, and Ebbo knows,&rdquo; said the trembling
Christina, &ldquo;that, were it a knightly exploit, I were the
first to exult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou! thou craftsman&rsquo;s girl! dost presume to call
in question the knightly deeds of a noble house!&nbsp;
There!&rdquo; cried the furious Baroness, striking her
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now! dare to be insolent again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her hand was uplifted for another blow, when it was grasped by
Eberhard, and, the next moment, he likewise held the other hand,
with youthful strength far exceeding hers.&nbsp; She had often
struck his mother before, but not in his presence, and the
greatness of the shock seemed to make him cool and absolutely
dignified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still, grandame,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
mother, I am not hurting her,&rdquo; and indeed the surprise
seemed to have taken away her rage and volubility, and
unresistingly she allowed him to seat her in a chair.&nbsp; Still
holding her arm, he made his clear boyish voice resound through
the hall, saying, &ldquo;Retainers all, know that, as I am your
lord and master, so is my honoured mother lady of the castle, and
she is never to be gainsay&rsquo;ed, let her say or do what she
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Herr Freiherr,&rdquo; said Heinz.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Frau Christina is our gracious and beloved dame.&nbsp;
Long live the Freiherrinn Christina!&rdquo; And the voices of
almost all the serfs present mingled in the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hear you all,&rdquo; continued Eberhard, &ldquo;she
shall rule all, and never be trampled on more.&nbsp; Grandame,
you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman seemed confounded, and cowered in her chair
without speaking.&nbsp; Christina, almost dismayed by this
silence, would have suggested to Ebbo to say something kind or
consoling; but at that moment she was struck with alarm by his
renewed inquiry for his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friedel!&nbsp; Was not he with thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I never saw him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo flew up the stairs, and shouted for his brother; then,
coming down, gave orders for the men to go out on the
mountain-side, and search and jodel.&nbsp; He was hurrying with
them, but his mother caught his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Ebbo, how can
I let you go?&nbsp; It is dark, and the crags are so
perilous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, I cannot stay!&rdquo; and the boy flung his
arms round her neck, and whispered in her ear, &ldquo;Friedel
said it would be a treacherous attack, and I called him a
craven.&nbsp; Oh, mother, we never parted thus before!&nbsp; He
went up the hillside.&nbsp; Oh, where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Infected by the boy&rsquo;s despairing voice, yet relieved
that Friedel at least had withstood the temptation, Christina
still held Ebbo&rsquo;s hand, and descended the steps with
him.&nbsp; The clear blue sky was fast showing the stars, and
into the evening stillness echoed the loud wide jodeln, cast back
from the other side of the ravine.&nbsp; Ebbo tried to raise his
voice, but broke down in the shout, and, choked with agitation,
said, &ldquo;Let me go, mother.&nbsp; None know his haunts as I
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she said, only grasping him tighter.</p>
<p>Thinner, shriller, clearer came a far-away cry from the
heights, and Ebbo thrilled from head to foot, then sent up
another pealing mountain shout, responded to by a jodel so
pitched as to be plainly not an echo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Towards the
Red Eyrie,&rdquo; said Hans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will have been to the Ptarmigan&rsquo;s Pool,&rdquo;
said Ebbo, sending up his voice again, in hopes that the answer
would sound less distant; but, instead of this, its intonations
conveyed, to these adepts in mountain language, that Friedel
stood in need of help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; said the startled Ebbo,
&ldquo;that he has got up amongst those rocks where the dead
chamois rolled down last summer;&rdquo; then, as Christina
uttered a faint cry of terror, Heinz added, &ldquo;Fear not,
lady, those are not the jodeln of one who has met with a
hurt.&nbsp; Baron Friedel has the sense to be patient rather than
risk his bones if he cannot move safely in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up after him!&rdquo; said Ebbo, emitting a variety of
shouts intimating speedy aid, and receiving a halloo in reply
that reassured even his mother.&nbsp; Equipped with a rope and
sundry torches of pinewood, Heinz and two of the serfs were
speedily ready, and Christina implored her son to let her come so
far as where she should not impede the others.&nbsp; He gave her
his arm, and Heinz held his torch so as to guide her up a winding
path, not in itself very steep, but which she could never have
climbed had daylight shown her what it overhung.&nbsp; Guided by
the constant exchange of jodeln, they reached a height where the
wind blew cold and wild, and Ebbo pointed to an intensely black
shadow overhung by a peak rising like the gable of a house into
the sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yonder lies the tarn,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir.&nbsp; This way lies the cliff.&nbsp;
Fried-mund!&rdquo; exchanging the jodel for the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&mdash;this way!&nbsp; Under the Red Eyrie,&rdquo;
called back the wanderer; and steering their course round the
rocks above the pool, the rescuers made their way towards the
base of the peak, which was in fact the summit of the mountain,
the top of the Eagle&rsquo;s Ladder, the highest step of which
they had attained.&nbsp; The peak towered over them, and beneath,
the castle lights seemed as if it would be easy to let a stone
fall straight down on them.</p>
<p>Friedel&rsquo;s cry seemed to come from under their
feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am here!&nbsp; I am safe; only it grew so
dark that I durst not climb up or down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Schneiderlein explained that he would lower down a rope,
which, when fastened round Friedel&rsquo;s waist, would enable
him to climb safely up; and, after a breathless space, the
torchlight shone upon the longed-for face, and Friedel springing
on the path, cried, &ldquo;The mother!&mdash;and
here!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Friedel, where have you been?&nbsp; What is this in
your arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed them the innocent face of a little white kid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence is it, Friedel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the peak, saying, &ldquo;I was lying on my back
by the tarn, when my lady eagle came sailing overhead, so low
that I could see this poor little thing, and hear it
bleat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast been to the Eyrie&mdash;the inaccessible
Eyrie!&rdquo; exclaimed Ebbo, in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mistake.&nbsp; It is not hard after the
first&rdquo; said Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only waited to watch
the old birds out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed the eagles!&nbsp; And the young ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Friedmund, as if half ashamed,
&ldquo;they were twin eaglets, and their mother had left them,
and I felt as though I could not harm them; so I only bore off
their provisions, and stuck some feathers in my cap.&nbsp; But by
that time the sun was down, and soon I could not see my footing;
and, when I found that I had missed the path, I thought I had
best nestle in the nook where I was, and wait for day.&nbsp; I
grieved for my mother&rsquo;s fear; but oh, to see her
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Friedel! didst do it to prove my words
false?&rdquo; interposed Ebbo, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest.&nbsp; Make me not speak them
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, those!&rdquo; said Friedel, only now recalling
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, verily; they were but a moment&rsquo;s
anger.&nbsp; I wanted to save the kid.&nbsp; I think it is old
mother Rika&rsquo;s white kid.&nbsp; But oh, motherling!&nbsp; I
grieve to have thus frightened you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a single word passed between them upon Ebbo&rsquo;s
exploits.&nbsp; Whether Friedel had seen all from the heights, or
whether he intuitively perceived that his brother preferred
silence, he held his peace, and both were solely occupied in
assisting their mother down the pass, the difficulties of which
were far more felt now than in the excitement of the ascent; only
when they were near home, and the boys were walking in the
darkness with arms round one another&rsquo;s necks, Christina
heard Friedel say low and rather sadly, &ldquo;I think I shall be
a priest, Ebbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Ebbo only answered, &ldquo;Pfui!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina understood that Friedel meant that robbery must be a
severance between the brothers.&nbsp; Alas! had the moment come
when their paths must diverge?&nbsp; Could Ebbo&rsquo;s step not
be redeemed?</p>
<p>Ursel reported that Dame Kunigunde had scarcely spoken again,
but had retired, like one stunned, into her bed.&nbsp; Friedel
was half asleep after the exertions of the day; but Ebbo did not
speak, and both soon betook themselves to their little turret
chamber within their mother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Christina prayed long that night, her heart full of dread of
the consequence of this transgression.&nbsp; Rumours of
freebooting castles destroyed by the Swabian League had reached
her every wake day, and, if this outrage were once known, the
sufferance that left Adlerstein unmolested must be over.&nbsp;
There was hope indeed in the weakness and uncertainty of the
Government; but present safety would in reality be the ruin of
Ebbo, since he would be encouraged to persist in the career of
violence now unhappily begun.&nbsp; She knew not what to ask,
save that her sons might be shielded from evil, and might fulfil
that promise of her dream, the star in heaven, the light on
earth.&nbsp; And for the present!&mdash;the good God guide her
and her sons through the difficult morrow, and turn the heart of
the unhappy old woman below!</p>
<p>When, exhausted with weeping and watching, she rose from her
knees, she stole softly into her sons&rsquo; turret for a last
look at them.&nbsp; Generally they were so much alike in their
sleep that even she was at fault between them; but that night
there was no doubt.&nbsp; Friedel, pale after the day&rsquo;s
hunger and fatigue, slept with relaxed features in the most
complete calm; but though Ebbo&rsquo;s eyes were closed, there
was no repose in his face&mdash;his hair was tossed, his colour
flushed, his brow contracted, the arm flung across his brother
had none of the ease of sleep.&nbsp; She doubted whether he were
not awake; but, knowing that he would not brook any endeavour to
force confidence he did not offer, she merely hung over them
both, murmured a prayer and blessing, and left them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CHOICE IN LIFE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Friedel</span>, wake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it day?&rdquo; said Friedel, slowly wakening, and
crossing himself as he opened his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely the
sun is not up&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be before the sun!&rdquo; said Ebbo, who was on
his feet, beginning to dress himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush, and
come!&nbsp; Do not wake the mother.&nbsp; It must be ere she or
aught else be astir!&nbsp; Thy prayers&mdash;I tell thee this is
a work as good as prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half awake, and entirely bewildered, Friedel dipped his finger
in the pearl mussel shell of holy water over their bed, and
crossed his own brow and his brother&rsquo;s; then, carrying
their shoes, they crossed their mother&rsquo;s chamber, and crept
down stairs.&nbsp; Ebbo muttered to his brother, &ldquo;Stand
thou still there, and pray the saints to keep her asleep;&rdquo;
and then, with bare feet, moved noiselessly behind the wooden
partition that shut off his grandmother&rsquo;s box-bedstead from
the rest of the hall.&nbsp; She lay asleep with open mouth,
snoring loudly, and on her pillow lay the bunch of castle keys,
that was always carried to her at night.&nbsp; It was a moment of
peril when Ebbo touched it; but he had nerved himself to be both
steady and dexterous, and he secured it without a jingle, and
then, without entering the hall, descended into a passage lit by
a rough opening cut in the rock.&nbsp; Friedel, who began to
comprehend, followed him close and joyfully, and at the first
door he fitted in, and with some difficulty turned, a key, and
pushed open the door of a vault, where morning light, streaming
through the grated window, showed two captives, who had started
to their feet, and now stood regarding the pair in the doorway as
if they thought their dreams were multiplying the young Baron who
had led the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Signori</i>&mdash;&rdquo; began the principal of the
two; but Ebbo spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you have been brought here by a mistake in the
absence of my mother, the lady of the castle.&nbsp; If you will
follow me, I will restore all that is within my reach, and put
you on your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant&rsquo;s knowledge of German was small, but the
purport of the words was plain, and he gladly left the damp,
chilly vault.&nbsp; Ebbo pointed to the bales that strewed the
hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take all that can be carried,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is your sword, and your purse,&rdquo; he
said, for these had been given to him in the moment of
victory.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will bring out your horse and lead you to
the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him food,&rdquo; whispered Friedel; but the
merchant was too anxious to have any appetite.&nbsp; Only he
faltered in broken German a proposal to pay his respects to the
Signora Castellana, to whom he owed so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; <i>Dormit in lecto</i>,&rdquo; said Ebbo,
with a sudden inspiration caught from the Latinized sound of some
of the Italian words, but colouring desperately as he spoke.</p>
<p>The Latin proved most serviceable, and the merchant understood
that his property was restored, and made all speed to gather it
together, and transport it to the stable.&nbsp; One or two of his
beasts of burden had been lost in the fray, and there were more
packages than could well be carried by the merchant, his servant,
and his horse.&nbsp; Ebbo gave the aid of the old white
mare&mdash;now very white indeed&mdash;and in truth the boys
pitied the merchant&rsquo;s fine young bay for being put to base
trading uses, and were rather shocked to hear that it had been
taken in payment for a knight&rsquo;s branched velvet gown, and
would be sold again at Ulm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a poor coxcomb of a knight!&rdquo; said they to
one another, as they patted the creature&rsquo;s neck with such
fervent admiration that the merchant longed to present it to
them, when he saw that the old white mare was the sole steed they
possessed, and watched their tender guidance both of her and of
the bay up the rocky path so familiar to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ah, <i>signorini miei</i>, I am an <i>infelice
infelicissimo</i>, ever persecuted by <i>le Fate</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&nbsp; A count like Schlangenwald?&rdquo; asked
Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Das Schicksal</i>,&rdquo; whispered Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three long miserable years did I spend as a captive
among the Moors, having lost all, my ships and all I had, and
being forced to row their galleys, <i>gli
scomunicati</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galleys!&rdquo; exclaimed Ebbo; &ldquo;there are some
pictured in our <i>World History before Carthage</i>.&nbsp; Would
that I could see one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>signorino</i> would soon have seen his fill,
were he between the decks, chained to the bench for weeks
together, without ceasing to row for twenty-four hours together,
with a renegade standing over to lash us, or to put a morsel into
our mouths if we were fainting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dogs!&nbsp; Do they thus use Christian men?&rdquo;
cried Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&igrave;</i>, <i>s&igrave;&mdash;ja wohl</i>.&nbsp;
There were a good fourscore of us, and among them a Tedesco, a
good man and true, from whom I learnt <i>la lingua
loro</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our tongue!&mdash;from whom?&rdquo; asked one twin of
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Tedesco, a fellow-countryman of <i>sue
eccellenze</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Deutscher</i>!&rdquo; cried both boys, turning in
horror, &ldquo;our Germans so treated by the pagan
villains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, truly, <i>signorini miei</i>.&nbsp; This
fellow-captive of mine was a <i>cavaliere</i> in his own land,
but he had been betrayed and sold by his enemies, and he mourned
piteously for <i>la sposa sua</i>&mdash;his bride, as they say
here.&nbsp; A goodly man and a tall, piteously cramped in the
narrow deck, I grieved to leave him there when the good
<i>confraternit&agrave;</i> at Genoa paid my ransom.&nbsp; Having
learnt to speak <i>il Tedesco</i>, and being no longer able to
fit out a vessel, I made my venture beyond the Alps; but, alas!
till this moment fortune has still been adverse.&nbsp; My mules
died of the toil of crossing the mountains; and, when with
reduced baggage I came to the river beneath there&mdash;when my
horses fell and my servants fled, and the peasants came down with
their hayforks&mdash;I thought myself in hands no better than
those of the Moors themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was wrongly done,&rdquo; said Ebbo, in an honest,
open tone, though blushing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have indeed a right to
what may be stranded on the bank, but never more shall foul means
be employed for the overthrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had by this time led the traveller through the
Gemsbock&rsquo;s Pass, within sight of the convent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;will they give you
harbourage, food, a guide, and a beast to carry the rest of your
goods.&nbsp; We are now upon convent land, and none will dare to
touch your bales; so I will unload old Schimmel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>signorino</i>, if I might offer any token of
gratitude&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Ebbo, with boyish lordliness,
&ldquo;make me not a spoiler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the <i>signorini</i> should ever come to
Genoa,&rdquo; continued the trader, &ldquo;and would honour Gian
Battista dei Battiste with a call, his whole house would be at
their feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks; I would that we could see strange lands!&rdquo;
said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;But come, Friedel, the sun is high, and I
locked them all into the castle to make matters safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the liberated captive know the name of his
deliverers, that he may commend it to the saints?&rdquo; asked
the merchant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Eberhard, Freiherr von Adlerstein, and this is
Freiherr Friedmund, my brother.&nbsp; Farewell, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; muttered the merchant, as he watched
the two boys turn down the pass, &ldquo;strange how like one
barbarous name is to another.&nbsp; Eberardo!&nbsp; That was what
we called <i>il Tedesco</i>, and, when he once told me his family
name, it ended in <i>stino</i>; but all these foreign names sound
alike.&nbsp; Let us speed on, lest these accursed peasants should
wake, and be beyond the control of the
<i>signorino</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Ebbo, as soon as he had hurried out
of reach of the temptation, &ldquo;small use in being a baron if
one is to be no better mounted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art glad to have let that fair creature go free,
though,&rdquo; said Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my mother&rsquo;s eyes would let me have no rest
in keeping him.&nbsp; Otherwise&mdash;Talk not to me of gladness,
Friedel!&nbsp; Thou shouldst know better.&nbsp; How is one to be
a knight with nothing to ride but a beast old enough to be his
grandmother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knighthood of the heart may be content to go
afoot,&rdquo; said Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Ebbo, what a brother
thou art!&nbsp; How happy the mother will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pfui, Friedel; what boots heart without spur?&nbsp; I
am sick of being mewed up here within these walls of rock!&nbsp;
No sport, not even with falling on a traveller.&nbsp; I am worse
off than ever were my forefathers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how is it?&nbsp; I cannot understand,&rdquo; asked
Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has changed thy mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou, and the mother, and, more than all, the
grandame.&nbsp; Listen, Friedel: when thou camest up, in all the
whirl of eagerness and glad preparation, with thy grave face and
murmur that Jobst had put forked stakes in the stream, it was
past man&rsquo;s endurance to be baulked of the fray.&nbsp; Thou
hast forgotten what I said to thee then, good Friedel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long since.&nbsp; No doubt I thrust in
vexatiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;and I saw thou hadst
reason, for the stakes were most maliciously planted, with long
branches hid by the current; but the fellows were showing fight,
and I could not stay to think then, or I should have seemed to
fear them!&nbsp; I can tell you we made them run!&nbsp; But I
never meant the grandmother to put yon poor fellow in the
dungeon, and use him worse than a dog.&nbsp; I wot that he was my
captive, and none of hers.&nbsp; And then came the mother; and
oh, Friedel, she looked as if I were slaying her when she saw the
spoil; and, ere I had made her see right and reason, the old lady
came swooping down in full malice and spite, and actually came to
blows.&nbsp; She struck the motherling&mdash;struck her on the
face, Friedel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear me it has so been before,&rdquo; said Friedel,
sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never will it be so again,&rdquo; said Ebbo, standing
still.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took the old hag by the hands, and told her
she had ruled long enough!&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s wife is as
good a lady of the castle as my grandfather&rsquo;s, and I myself
am lord thereof; and, since my Lady Kunigunde chooses to cross me
and beat my mother about this capture, why she has seen the last
of it, and may learn who is master, and who is
mistress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ebbo!&nbsp; I would I had seen it!&nbsp; But was
not she outrageous?&nbsp; Was not the mother shrinking and ready
to give back all her claims at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she would have been, but just then she found
thou wast not with me, and I found thou wast not with her, and we
thought of nought else.&nbsp; But thou must stand by me, Friedel,
and help to keep the grandmother in her place, and the mother in
hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the mother <i>will</i> be kept,&rdquo; said
Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear me she will only plead to be left to
the grandame&rsquo;s treatment, as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Friedel!&nbsp; I will never see her so used
again.&nbsp; I released this man solely to show that she is to
rule here.&mdash;Yes, I know all about freebooting being a deadly
sin, and moreover that it will bring the League about our ears;
and it was a cowardly trick of Jobst to put those branches in the
stream.&nbsp; Did I not go over it last night till my brain was
dizzy?&nbsp; But still, it is but living and dying like our
fathers, and I hate tameness or dullness, and it is like a fool
to go back from what one has once begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it is like a brave man, when one has begun
wrong,&rdquo; said Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then I thought of the grandame triumphing over the
gentle mother&mdash;and I know the mother wept over her beads
half the night.&nbsp; She <i>shall</i> find she has had her own
way for once this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedel was silent for a few moments, then said, &ldquo;Let me
tell thee what I saw yesterday, Ebbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; answered the other brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked not to vex my mother by my tidings, so I
climbed up to the tarn.&nbsp; There is something always healing
in that spot, is it not so, Ebbo?&nbsp; When the grandmother has
been raving&rdquo; (hitherto Friedel&rsquo;s worst grievance)
&ldquo;it is like getting up nearer the quiet sky in the
stillness there, when the sky seems to have come down into the
deep blue water, and all is so still, so wondrous still and
calm.&nbsp; I wonder if, when we see the great Dome Kirk itself,
it will give one&rsquo;s spirit wings, as does the gazing up from
the Ptarmigan&rsquo;s Pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou minnesinger, was it the blue sky thou hadst to
tell me of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother, it was ere I reached it that I saw this
sight.&nbsp; I had scaled the peak where grows the stunted rowan,
and I sat down to look down on the other side of the gorge.&nbsp;
It was clear where I sat, but the ravine was filled with clouds,
and upon them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shape of the blessed Friedmund, thy
patron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Our</i> patron,&rdquo; said Friedel; &ldquo;I saw
him, a giant form in gown and hood, traced in grey shadow upon
the dazzling white cloud; and oh, Ebbo! he was struggling with a
thinner, darker, wilder shape bearing a club.&nbsp; He strove to
withhold it; his gestures threatened and warned!&nbsp; I watched
like one spell-bound, for it was to me as the guardian spirit of
our race striving for thee with the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cloud darkened, and swallowed them; nor should I
have known the issue, if suddenly, on the very cloud where the
strife had been, there had not beamed forth a rainbow&mdash;not a
common rainbow, Ebbo, but a perfect ring, a soft-glancing,
many-tinted crown of victory.&nbsp; Then I knew the saint had
won, and that thou wouldst win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I!&nbsp; What, not thyself&mdash;his own
namesake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, Ebbo, if the fight went very hard&mdash;nay,
if for a time the grandame led thee her way&mdash;that belike I
might serve thee best by giving up all, and praying for thee in
the hermit&rsquo;s cave, or as a monk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou!&mdash;thou, my other self!&nbsp; Aid me by
burrowing in a hole like a rat!&nbsp; What foolery wilt say
next?&nbsp; No, no, Friedel, strike by my side, and I will strike
with thee; pray by my side, and I will pray with thee; but if
thou takest none of the strokes, then will I none of the
prayers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ebbo, thou knowest not what thou sayest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows better!&nbsp; See, Friedel, wouldst thou
have me all that the old Adlersteinen were, and worse too? then
wilt thou leave me and hide thine head in some priestly
cowl.&nbsp; Maybe thou thinkest to pray my soul into safety at
the last moment as a favour to thine own abundant sanctity; but I
tell thee, Friedel, that&rsquo;s no manly way to salvation.&nbsp;
If thou follow&rsquo;st that track, I&rsquo;ll take care to get
past the border-line within which prayer can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedel crossed himself, and uttered an imploring exclamation
of horror at these wild words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;I said not I meant any
such thing&mdash;so long as thou wilt be with me.&nbsp; My
purpose is to be a good man and true, a guard to the weak, a
defence against the Turk, a good lord to my vassals, and, if it
may not be otherwise, I will take my oath to the Kaiser, and keep
it.&nbsp; Is that enough for thee, Friedel, or wouldst thou see
me a monk at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ebbo, this is what we ever planned.&nbsp; I only
dreamed of the other when&mdash;when thou didst seem to be on the
other track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what can I do more than turn back?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll get absolution on Sunday, and tell Father Norbert that
I will do any penance he pleases; and warn Jobst that, if he sets
any more traps in the river, I will drown him there next!&nbsp;
Only get this priestly fancy away, Friedel, once and for
ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never could I think of what would sever
us,&rdquo; cried Friedel, &ldquo;save&mdash;when&mdash;&rdquo; he
added, hesitating, unwilling to harp on the former string.&nbsp;
Ebbo broke in imperiously,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friedmund von Adlerstein, give me thy solemn word that
I never again hear of this freak of turning priest or
hermit.&nbsp; What! art slow to speak?&nbsp; Thinkest me too bad
for thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ebbo.&nbsp; Heaven knows thou art stronger, more
resolute than I.&nbsp; I am more likely to be too bad for
thee.&nbsp; But so long as we can be true, faithful God-fearing
Junkern together, Heaven forbid that we should part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our bond!&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;nought shall
part us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nought but death,&rdquo; said Friedmund, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Ebbo, with perfect
seriousness, &ldquo;I do not believe that one of us can live or
die without the other.&nbsp; But, hark! there&rsquo;s an outcry
at the castle!&nbsp; They have found out that they are locked
in!&nbsp; Ha! ho! hilloa, Hatto, how like you playing
prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo would have amused himself with the dismay of his garrison
a little longer, had not Friedel reminded him that their mother
might be suffering for their delay, and this suggestion made him
march in hastily.&nbsp; He found her standing drooping under the
pitiless storm which Frau Kunigunde was pouring out at the
highest pitch of her cracked, trembling voice, one hand uplifted
and clenched, the other grasping the back of a chair, while her
whole frame shook with rage too mighty for her strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandame,&rdquo; said Ebbo, striding up to the scene of
action, &ldquo;cease.&nbsp; Remember my words
yestereve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has stolen the keys!&nbsp; She has tampered with
the servants!&nbsp; She has released the prisoner&mdash;thy
prisoner, Ebbo!&nbsp; She has cheated us as she did with <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Wildschloss!&nbsp; False burgherinn!&nbsp; I trow she
wanted another suitor!&nbsp; Bane&mdash;pest of
Adlerstein!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedmund threw a supporting arm round his mother, but Ebbo
confronted the old lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I freed the captive.&nbsp; I stole the keys&mdash;I
and Friedel!&nbsp; No one else knew my purpose.&nbsp; He was my
captive, and I released him because he was foully taken.&nbsp; I
have chosen my lot in life,&rdquo; he added; and, standing in the
middle of the hall, he took off his cap, and spoke
gravely:&mdash;&ldquo;I will not be a treacherous robber-outlaw,
but, so help me God, a faithful, loyal, godly
nobleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother and Friedel breathed an &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; with all
their hearts; and he continued,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou, grandame, peace!&nbsp; Such reverence shalt
thou have as befits my father&rsquo;s mother; but henceforth mine
own lady-mother is the mistress of this castle, and whoever
speaks a rude word to her offends the Freiherr von
Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>That last day&rsquo;s work had made a great step in
Ebbo&rsquo;s life, and there he stood, grave and firm, ready for
the assault; for, in effect, he and all besides expected that the
old lady would fly at him or at his mother like a wild cat, as
she would assuredly have done in a like case a year earlier; but
she took them all by surprise by collapsing into her chair and
sobbing piteously.&nbsp; Ebbo, much distressed, tried to make her
understand that she was to have all care and honour; but she
muttered something about ingratitude, and continued to exhaust
herself with weeping, spurning away all who approached her; and
thenceforth she lived in a gloomy, sullen acquiescence in her
deposition.</p>
<p>Christina inclined to the opinion that she must have had some
slight stroke in the night, for she was never the same woman
again; her vigour had passed away, and she would sit spinning, or
rocking herself in her chair, scarcely alive to what passed, or
scolding and fretting like a shadow of her old violence.&nbsp;
Nothing pleased her but the attentions of her grandsons, and
happily she soon ceased to know them apart, and gave Ebbo credit
for all that was done for her by Friedel, whose separate
existence she seemed to have forgotten.</p>
<p>As long as her old spirit remained she would not suffer the
approach of her daughter-in-law, and Christina could only make
suggestions for her comfort to be acted on by Ursel; and though
the reins of government fast dropped from the aged hands, they
were but gradually and cautiously assumed by the younger
Baroness.</p>
<p>Only Elsie remained of the rude, demoralized girls whom she
had found in the castle, and their successors, though dull and
uncouth, were meek and manageable; the men of the castle had all,
except M&auml;tz, been always devoted to the Frau Christina; and
M&auml;tz, to her great relief, ran away so soon as he found that
decency and honesty were to be the rule.&nbsp; Old Hatto,
humpbacked Hans, and Heinz the Schneiderlein, were the whole male
establishment, and had at least the merit of attachment to
herself and her sons; and in time there was a shade of greater
civilization about the castle, though impeded both by dire
poverty and the doggedness of the old retainers.&nbsp; At least
the court was cleared of the swine, and, within doors, the table
was spread with dainty linen out of the parcels from Ulm, and the
meals served with orderliness that annoyed the boys at first, but
soon became a subject of pride and pleasure.</p>
<p>Frau Kunigunde lingered long, with increasing
infirmities.&nbsp; After the winter day, when, running down at a
sudden noise, Friedel picked her up from the hearthstone,
scorched, bruised, almost senseless, she accepted
Christina&rsquo;s care with nothing worse than a snarl, and
gradually seemed to forget the identity of her nurse with the
interloping burgher girl.&nbsp; Thanks or courtesy had been no
part of her nature, least of all towards her own sex, and she did
little but grumble, fret, and revile her attendant; but she soon
depended so much on Christina&rsquo;s care, that it was hardly
possible to leave her.&nbsp; At her best and strongest, her talk
was maundering abuse of her son&rsquo;s low-born wife; but at
times her wanderings showed black gulfs of iniquity and
coarseness of soul that would make the gentle listener tremble,
and be thankful that her sons were out of hearing.&nbsp; And thus
did Christina von Adlerstein requite fifteen years of
persecution.</p>
<p>The old lady&rsquo;s first failure had been in the summer of
1488; it was the Advent season of 1489, when the snow was at the
deepest, and the frost at the hardest, that the two hardy
mountaineer grandsons fetched over the pass Father Norbert, and a
still sturdier, stronger monk, to the dying woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we in time, mother?&rdquo; asked Ebbo, from the
door of the upper chamber, where the Adlersteins began and ended
life, shaking the snow from his mufflings.&nbsp; Ruddy with
exertion in the sharp wind, what a contrast he was to all within
the room!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said a thin, feeble voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Ebbo.&nbsp; It is the Baron,&rdquo; said
Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in, Ebbo.&nbsp; She is somewhat
revived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she be able to speak to the priest?&rdquo; asked
Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priest!&rdquo; feebly screamed the old woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No priest for me!&nbsp; My lord died unshriven,
unassoilzied.&nbsp; Where he is, there will I be.&nbsp; Let a
priest approach me at his peril!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stony insensibility ensued; nor did she speak again, though
life lasted many hours longer.&nbsp; The priests did their
office; for, impenitent as the life and frantic as the words had
been, the opinions of the time deemed that their rites might yet
give the departing soul a chance, though the body was
unconscious.</p>
<p>When all was over, snow was again falling, shifting and
drifting, so that it was impossible to leave the castle, and the
two monks were kept there for a full fortnight, during which
Christmas solemnities were observed in the chapel, for the first
time since the days of Friedmund the Good.&nbsp; The corpse of
Kunigunde, preserved&mdash;we must say the word&mdash;salted, was
placed in a coffin, and laid in that chapel to await the melting
of the snows, when the vault at the Hermitage could be
opened.&nbsp; And this could not be effected till Easter had
nearly come round again, and it was within a week of their
sixteenth birthday that the two young Barons stood together at
the coffin&rsquo;s head, serious indeed, but more with the
thought of life than of death.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BACK TO THE DOVECOTE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the first time in her residence
at Adlerstein, now full half her life, the Freiherrinn Christina
ventured to send a messenger to Ulm, namely, a lay brother of the
convent of St. Ruprecht, who undertook to convey to Master
Gottfried Sorel her letter, informing him of the death of her
mother-in-law, and requesting him to send the same tidings to the
Freiherr von Adlerstein Wildschloss, the kinsman and godfather of
her sons.</p>
<p>She was used to wait fifty-two weeks for answers to her
letters, and was amazed when, at the end of three, two stout
serving-men were guided by Jobst up the pass; but her heart
warmed to their flat caps and round jerkins, they looked so like
home.&nbsp; They bore a letter of invitation to her and her sons
to come at once to her uncle&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The King of the
Romans, and perhaps the Emperor, were to come to the city early
in the summer, and there could be no better opportunity of
presenting the young Barons to their sovereign.&nbsp; Sir Kasimir
of Adlerstein Wildschloss would meet them there for the purpose,
and would obtain their admission to the League, in which all
Swabian nobles had bound themselves to put down robbery and
oppression, and outside which there was nothing but outlawry and
danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So must it be?&rdquo; said Ebbo, between his teeth, as
he leant moodily against the wall, while his mother was gone to
attend to the fare to be set before the messengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! art not glad to take wing at last?&rdquo;
exclaimed Friedel, cut short in an exclamation of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take wing, forsooth!&nbsp; To be guest of a greasy
burgher, and call cousin with him!&nbsp; Fear not, Friedel;
I&rsquo;ll not vex the motherling.&nbsp; Heaven knows she has had
pain, grief, and subjection enough in her lifetime, and I would
not hinder her visit to her home; but I would she could go alone,
nor make us show our poverty to the swollen city folk, and listen
to their endearments.&nbsp; I charge thee, Friedel, do as I do;
be not too familiar with them.&nbsp; Could we but sprain an ankle
over the crag&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, she would stay to nurse us,&rdquo; said Friedel,
laughing; &ldquo;besides, thou art needed for the matter of
homage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Friedel,&rdquo; said Ebbo, sinking his voice,
&ldquo;I shall not lightly yield my freedom to king or
Kaiser.&nbsp; Maybe, there is no help for it; but it irks me to
think that I should be the last Lord of Adlerstein to whom the
title of Freiherr is not a mockery.&nbsp; Why dost bend thy brow,
brother?&nbsp; What art thinking of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a saying in my mother&rsquo;s book, that
well-ordered service is true freedom,&rdquo; said Friedel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And methinks there will be freedom in rushing at last into
the great far-off!&rdquo;&mdash;the boy&rsquo;s eye expanded and
glistened with eagerness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here are we
prisoners&mdash;to ourselves, if you like&mdash;but prisoners
still, pent up in the rocks, seeing no one, hearing scarce an
echo from the knightly or the poet world, nor from all the
wonders that pass.&nbsp; And the world has a history going on
still, like the <i>Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; Oh, Ebbo, think of being
in the midst of life, with lance and sword, and seeing the
Kaiser&mdash;the Kaiser of the holy Roman Empire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With lance and sword, well and good; but would it were
not at the cost of liberty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However Ebbo forbore to damp his mother&rsquo;s joy, save by
the one warning&mdash;&ldquo;Understand, mother, that I will not
be pledged to anything.&nbsp; I will not bend to the yoke ere I
have seen and judged for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manly sound of the words gave a sweet sense of exultation
to the mother, even while she dreaded the proud spirit, and
whispered, &ldquo;God direct thee, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly Ebbo, hitherto the most impetuous and least
thoughtful of the two lads, had a gravity and seriousness about
him, that, but for his naturally sweet temper, would have seemed
sullen.&nbsp; His aspirations for adventure had hitherto been
more vehement than Friedel&rsquo;s; but, when the time seemed at
hand, his regrets at what he might have to yield overpowered his
hopes of the future.&nbsp; The fierce haughtiness of the old
Adlersteins could not brook the descent from the crag, even while
the keen, clear burgher wit that Ebbo inherited from the other
side of the house taught him that the position was untenable, and
that his isolated glory was but a poor mean thing after
all.&nbsp; And the struggle made him sad and moody.</p>
<p>Friedel, less proud, and with nothing to yield, was open to
blithe anticipations of what his fancy pictured as the home of
all the beauty, sacred or romantic, that he had glimpsed at
through his mother.&nbsp; Religion, poetry, learning, art,
refinement, had all come to him through her; and though he had a
soul that dreamt and soared in the lonely grandeur of the
mountain heights, it craved further aliment for its yearnings for
completeness and perfection.&nbsp; Long ago had Friedel come to
the verge of such attainments as he could work out of his present
materials, and keen had been his ardour for the means of
progress, though only the mountain tarn had ever been witness to
the full outpouring of the longings with which he gazed upon the
dim, distant city like a land of enchantment.</p>
<p>The journey was to be at once, so as to profit by the escort
of Master Sorel&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; Means of transport were
scanty, but Ebbo did not choose that the messengers should report
the need, and bring back a bevy of animals at the burgher&rsquo;s
expense; so the mother was mounted on the old white mare, and her
sons and Heinz trusted to their feet.&nbsp; By setting out early
on a May morning, the journey could be performed ere night, and
the twilight would find them in the domains of the free city,
where their small numbers would be of no importance.&nbsp; As to
their appearance, the mother wore a black woollen gown and
mantle, and a black silk hood tied under her chin, and sitting
loosely round the stiff frame of her white cap&mdash;a nun-like
garb, save for the soft brown hair, parted over her brow, and
more visible than she sometimes thought correct, but her sons
would not let her wear it out of sight.</p>
<p>The brothers had piece by piece surveyed the solitary suit of
armour remaining in the castle; but, though it might serve for
defence, it could not be made fit for display, and they must
needs be contented with blue cloth, spun, woven, dyed, fashioned,
and sewn at home, chiefly by their mother, and by her embroidered
on the breast with the white eagle of Adlerstein.&nbsp; Short
blue cloaks and caps of the same, with an eagle plume in each,
and leggings neatly fashioned of deerskin, completed their
equipments.&nbsp; Ebbo wore his father&rsquo;s sword, Friedel had
merely a dagger and crossbow.&nbsp; There was not a gold chain,
not a brooch, not an approach to an ornament among the three,
except the medal that had always distinguished Ebbo, and the
coral rosary at Christina&rsquo;s girdle.&nbsp; Her own trinkets
had gone in masses for the souls of her father and husband; and
though a few costly jewels had been found in Frau
Kunigunde&rsquo;s hoards, the mode of their acquisition was so
doubtful, that it had seemed fittest to bestow them in alms and
masses for the good of her soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ornament, what glory could any one desire better
than two such sons?&rdquo; thought Christina, as for the first
time for eighteen years she crossed the wild ravine where her
father had led her, a trembling little captive, longing for wings
like a dove&rsquo;s to flutter home again.&nbsp; Who would then
have predicted that she should descend after so long and weary a
time, and with a gallant boy on either side of her, eager to aid
her every step, and reassure her at each giddy pass, all joy and
hope before her and them?&nbsp; Yet she was not without some
dread and misgiving, as she watched her elder son, always
attentive to her, but unwontedly silent, with a stern gravity on
his young brow, a proud sadness on his lip.&nbsp; And when he had
come to the Debateable Ford, and was about to pass the boundaries
of his own lands, he turned and gazed back on the castle and
mountain with a silent but passionate ardour, as though he felt
himself doing them a wrong by perilling their independence.</p>
<p>The sun had lately set, and the moon was silvering the Danube,
when the travellers came full in view of the imperial free city,
girt in with mighty walls and towers&mdash;the vine-clad hill
dominated by its crowning church; the irregular outlines of the
unfinished spire of the cathedral traced in mysterious dark
lacework against the pearly sky; the lofty steeple-like
gate-tower majestically guarding the bridge.&nbsp; Christina
clasped her hands in thankfulness, as at the familiar face of a
friend; Friedel glowed like a minstrel introduced to his fair
dame, long wooed at a distance; Ebbo could not but exclaim,
&ldquo;Yea, truly, a great city is a solemn and a glorious
sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gates were closed, and the serving-men had to parley at
the barbican ere the heavy door was opened to admit the party to
the bridge, between deep battlemented stone walls, with here and
there loopholes, showing the shimmering of the river
beneath.&nbsp; The slow, tired tread of the old mare sounded
hollow; the river rushed below with the full swell of evening
loudness; a deep-toned convent-bell tolled gravely through the
stillness, while, between its reverberations, clear, distinct
notes of joyous music were borne on the summer wind, and a
nightingale sung in one of the gardens that bordered the
banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, it is all that I dreamt!&rdquo; breathlessly
murmured Friedel, as they halted under the dark arch of the great
gateway tower.</p>
<p>Not however in Friedel&rsquo;s dreams had been the hearty
voice that proceeded from the lighted guard-room in the thickness
of the gateway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Freiherrinn von Adlerstein!&nbsp; Is
it she?&nbsp; Then must I greet my old playmate!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
the captain of the watch appeared among upraised lanterns and
torches that showed a broad, smooth, plump face beneath a plain
steel helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, gracious lady, welcome to your old city.&nbsp;
What! do you not remember Lippus Grundt, your poor
Valentine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Philip Grundt!&rdquo; exclaimed Christina,
amazed at the breadth of visage and person; &ldquo;and how fares
it with my good Regina?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent well, good lady.&nbsp; She manages her trade
and house as well as the good man Bartol&auml;us Fleischer
himself.&nbsp; Blithe will she be to show you her goodly ten, as
I shall my eight,&rdquo; he continued, walking by her side;
&ldquo;and Barbara&mdash;you remember Barbara Schmidt,
lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Barbara?&mdash;That do I indeed!&nbsp; Is she
your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, truly, lady,&rdquo; he answered, in an odd sort of
apologetic tone; &ldquo;you see, you returned not, and the
housefathers, they would have it so&mdash;and Barbara is a good
housewife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly do I rejoice!&rdquo; said Christina, wishing she
could convey to him how welcome he had been to marry any one he
liked, as far as she was concerned&mdash;he, in whom her fears of
mincing goldsmiths had always taken form&mdash;then signing with
her hand, &ldquo;I have my sons likewise to show her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, on foot!&rdquo; muttered Grundt, as a not
well-conceived apology for not having saluted the young
gentlemen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I greet you well, sirs,&rdquo; with a
bow, most haughtily returned by Ebbo, who was heartily wishing
himself on his mountain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two lusty, well-grown
Junkern indeed, to whom my Martin will be proud to show the
humours of Ulm.&nbsp; A fair good night, lady!&nbsp; You will
find the old folks right cheery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well did Christina know the turn down the street, darkened by
the overhanging brows of the tall houses, but each lower window
laughing with the glow of light within that threw out the heavy
mullions and the circles and diamonds of the latticework, and
here and there the brilliant tints of stained glass sparkled like
jewels in the upper panes, pictured with Scripture scene, patron
saint, or trade emblem.&nbsp; The familiar porch was reached, the
familiar knock resounded on the iron-studded door.&nbsp; Friedel
lifted his mother from her horse, and felt that she was quivering
from head to foot, and at the same moment the light streamed from
the open door on the white horse, and the two young faces, one
eager, the other with knit brows and uneasy eyes.&nbsp; A kind of
echo pervaded the house, &ldquo;She is come! she is come!&rdquo;
and as one in a dream Christina entered, crossed the well-known
hall, looked up to her uncle and aunt on the stairs, perceived
little change on their countenances, and sank upon her knees,
with bowed head and clasped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child! my dear child!&rdquo; exclaimed her uncle,
raising her with one hand, and crossing her brow in benediction
with the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art thou indeed returned?&rdquo; and
he embraced her tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, fair niece!&rdquo; said Hausfrau Johanna, more
formally.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am right glad to greet you
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear mother!&rdquo; cried Christina, courting her
fond embrace by gestures of the most eager affection, &ldquo;how
have I longed for this moment! and, above all, to show you my
boys!&nbsp; Herr Uncle, let me present my sons&mdash;my Eberhard,
my Friedmund.&nbsp; O Housemother, are not my twins well-grown
lads?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she stood with a hand on each, proud that
their heads were so far above her own, and looking still so
slight and girlish in figure that she might better have been
their sister than their mother.&nbsp; The cloud that the sudden
light had revealed on Ebbo&rsquo;s brow had cleared away, and he
made an inclination neither awkward nor ungracious in its free
mountain dignity and grace, but not devoid of mountain rusticity
and shy pride, and far less cordial than was Friedel&rsquo;s
manner.&nbsp; Both were infinitely relieved to detect nothing of
the greasy burgher, and were greatly struck with the fine
venerable head before them; indeed, Friedel would, like his
mother, have knelt to ask a blessing, had he not been under
command not to outrun his brother&rsquo;s advances towards her
kindred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, fair Junkern!&rdquo; said Master Gottfried;
&ldquo;welcome both for your mother&rsquo;s sake and your
own!&nbsp; These thy sons, my little one?&rdquo; he added,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art sure I neither dream nor see
double!&nbsp; Come to the gallery, and let me see thee
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, ceremoniously giving his hand, he proceeded to lead his
niece up the stairs, while Ebbo, labouring under ignorance of
city forms and uncertainty of what befitted his dignity,
presented his hand to his aunt with an air that half-amused,
half-offended the shrewd dame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is as if I had left you but yesterday!&rdquo;
exclaimed Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;Uncle, have you pardoned
me?&nbsp; You bade me return when my work was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have known better, child.&nbsp; Such return is
not to be sought on this side the grave.&nbsp; Thy work has been
more than I then thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! and now will you deem it begun&mdash;not
done!&rdquo; softly said Christina, though with too much
heartfelt exultation greatly to doubt that all the world must be
satisfied with two such boys, if only Ebbo would be his true
self.</p>
<p>The luxury of the house, the wainscoted and tapestried walls,
the polished furniture, the lamps and candles, the damask linen,
the rich array of silver, pewter, and brightly-coloured glass,
were a great contrast to the bare walls and scant necessaries of
Schloss Adlerstein; but Ebbo was resolved not to expose himself
by admiration, and did his best to stifle Friedel&rsquo;s
exclamations of surprise and delight.&nbsp; Were not these
citizens to suppose that everything was tenfold more costly at
the baronial castle?&nbsp; And truly the boy deserved credit for
the consideration for his mother, which made him merely reserved,
while he felt like a wild eagle in a poultry-yard.&nbsp; It was
no small proof of his affection to forbear more interference with
his mother&rsquo;s happiness than was the inevitable effect of
that intuition which made her aware that he was chafing and ill
at ease.&nbsp; For his sake, she allowed herself to be placed in
the seat of honour, though she longed, as of old, to nestle at
her uncle&rsquo;s feet, and be again his child; but, even while
she felt each acceptance of a token of respect as almost an
injury to them, every look and tone was showing how much the same
Christina she had returned.</p>
<p>In truth, though her life had been mournful and oppressed, it
had not been such as to age her early.&nbsp; It had been all
submission, without wear and tear of mind, and too simple in its
trials for care and moiling; so the fresh, lily-like sweetness of
her maiden bloom was almost intact, and, much as she had
undergone, her once frail health had been so braced by the
mountain breezes, that, though delicacy remained, sickliness was
gone from her appearance.&nbsp; There was still the exquisite
purity and tender modesty of expression, but with greater
sweetness in the pensive brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, little one!&rdquo; said her uncle, after duly
contemplating her; &ldquo;the change is all for the better!&nbsp;
Thou art grown a wondrously fair dame.&nbsp; There will scarce be
a lovelier in the Kaiserly train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo almost pardoned his great-uncle for being his
great-uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she is arrayed as becomes the Frau
Freiherrinn,&rdquo; said the housewife aunt, looking with concern
at the coarse texture of her black sleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;I long to
see our own lady ruffle it in her new gear.&nbsp; I am glad that
the lofty pointed cap has passed out; the coif becomes my child
far better, and I see our tastes still accord as to
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fashion scarce came above the Debateable Ford,&rdquo;
said Christina, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear my boys look as if
they came out of the <i>Weltgeschichte</i>, for I could only
shape their garments after my remembrance of the gallants of
eighteen years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their garments are your own shaping!&rdquo; exclaimed
the aunt, now in an accent of real, not conventional respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spinning and weaving, shaping and sewing,&rdquo; said
Friedel, coming near to let the housewife examine the
texture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close woven, even threaded, smooth tinted!&nbsp; Ah,
Stina, thou didst learn something!&nbsp; Thou wert not quite
spoilt by the housefather&rsquo;s books and carvings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell whose teachings have served me best, or
been the most precious to me,&rdquo; said Christina, with clasped
hands, looking from one to another with earnest love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art a good child.&nbsp; Ah! little one, forgive
me; you look so like our child that I cannot bear in mind that
you are the Frau Freiherrinn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I should deem myself in disgrace with you, did you
keep me at a distance, and not <i>thou</i> me, as your little
Stina,&rdquo; she fondly answered, half regretting her fond eager
movement, as Ebbo seemed to shrink together with a gesture
perceived by her uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my young lord there who would not forgive the
freedom,&rdquo; he said, good-humouredly, though gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; Ebbo forced himself to say; &ldquo;not
so, if it makes my mother happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up his head rather as if he thought it a fool&rsquo;s
paradise, but Master Gottfried answered: &ldquo;The noble
Freiherr is, from all I have heard, too good a son to grudge his
mother&rsquo;s duteous love even to burgher kindred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in the old man&rsquo;s frank, dignified
tone of grave reproof that at once impressed Ebbo with a sense of
the true superiority of that wise and venerable old age to his
own petulant baronial self-assertion.&nbsp; He had both head and
heart to feel the burgher&rsquo;s victory, and with a deep blush,
though not without dignity, he answered, &ldquo;Truly, sir, my
mother has ever taught us to look up to you as her kindest and
best&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going to say &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; but a look into the
grand benignity of the countenance completed the conquest, and he
turned it into &ldquo;father.&rdquo;&nbsp; Friedel at the same
instant bent his knee, exclaiming, &ldquo;It is true what Ebbo
says!&nbsp; We have both longed for this day.&nbsp; Bless us,
honoured uncle, as you have blessed my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For in truth there was in the soul of the boy, who had never
had any but women to look up to, a strange yearning towards
reverence, which was called into action with inexpressible force
by the very aspect and tone of such a sage elder and counsellor
as Master Gottfried Sorel, and he took advantage of the first
opening permitted by his brother.&nbsp; And the sympathy always
so strong between the two quickened the like feeling in Ebbo, so
that the same movement drew him on his knee beside Friedel in
oblivion or renunciation of all lordly pride towards a kinsman
such as he had here encountered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly and heartily, my fair youths,&rdquo; said Master
Gottfried, with the same kind dignity, &ldquo;do I pray the good
God to bless you, and render you faithful and loving sons, not
only to your mother, but to your fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was unable to distinguish between the two exactly similar
forms that knelt before him, yet there was something in the
quivering of Friedel&rsquo;s head, which made him press it with a
shade more of tenderness than the other.&nbsp; And in truth tears
were welling into the eyes veiled by the fingers that Friedel
clasped over his face, for such a blessing was strange and sweet
to him.</p>
<p>Their mother was ready to weep for joy.&nbsp; There was now no
drawback to her bliss, since her son and her uncle had accepted
one another; and she repaired to her own beloved old chamber a
happier being than she had been since she had left its wainscoted
walls.</p>
<p>Nay, as she gazed out at the familiar outlines of roof and
tower, and felt herself truly at home, then knelt by the little
undisturbed altar of her devotions, with the cross above and her
own patron saint below in carved wood, and the flowers which the
good aunt had ever kept as a freshly renewed offering, she felt
that she was happier, more fully thankful and blissful than even
in the girlish calm of her untroubled life.&nbsp; Her prayer that
she might come again in peace had been more than fulfilled; nay,
when she had seen her boys kneel meekly to receive her
uncle&rsquo;s blessing, it was in some sort to her as if the work
was done, as if the millstone had been borne up for her, and had
borne her and her dear ones with it.</p>
<p>But there was much to come.&nbsp; She knew full well that,
even though her sons&rsquo; first step had been in the right
direction, it was in a path beset with difficulties; and how
would her proud Ebbo meet them?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EAGLETS IN THE CITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> having once accepted Master
Gottfried, Ebbo froze towards him and Dame Johanna no more, save
that a naturally imperious temper now and then led to fitful
stiffnesses and momentary haughtiness, which were easily excused
in one so new to the world and afraid of compromising his
rank.&nbsp; In general he could afford to enjoy himself with a
zest as hearty as that of the simpler-minded Friedel.</p>
<p>They were early afoot, but not before the heads of the
household were coming forth for the morning devotions at the
cathedral; and the streets were stirring into activity, and
becoming so peopled that the boys supposed that it was a great
fair day.&nbsp; They had never seen so many people together even
at the Friedmund Wake, and it was several days before they ceased
to exclaim at every passenger as a new curiosity.</p>
<p>The Dome Kirk awed and hushed them.&nbsp; They had looked to
it so long that perhaps no sublunary thing could have realized
their expectations, and Friedel avowed that he did not know what
he thought of it.&nbsp; It was not such as he had dreamt, and,
like a German as he was, he added that he could not think, he
could only feel, that there was something ineffable in it; yet he
was almost disappointed to find his visions unfulfilled, and the
hues of the painted glass less pure and translucent than those of
the ice crystals on the mountains.&nbsp; However after his eye
had become trained, the deep influence of its dim solemn majesty,
and of the echoes of its organ tones, and chants of high praise
or earnest prayer, began to enchain his spirit; and, if ever he
were missing, he was sure to be found among the mysteries of the
cathedral aisles, generally with Ebbo, who felt the spell of the
same grave fascination, since whatever was true of the one
brother was generally true of the other.&nbsp; They were
essentially alike, though some phases of character and taste were
more developed in the one or the other.</p>
<p>Master Gottfried was much edified by their perfect knowledge
of the names and numbers of his books.&nbsp; They instantly,
almost resentfully, missed the Cicero&rsquo;s <i>Offices</i> that
he had parted with, and joyfully hailed his new acquisitions,
often sitting with heads together over the same book, reading
like active-minded youths who were used to out-of-door life and
exercise in superabundant measure, and to study as a valued
recreation, with only food enough for the intellect to awaken
instead of satisfying it.</p>
<p>They were delighted to obtain instruction from a travelling
student, then attending the schools of Ulm&mdash;a meek, timid
lad who, for love of learning and desire of the priesthood, had
endured frightful tyranny from the Bacchanten or elder scholars,
and, having at length attained that rank, had so little heart to
retaliate on the juniors that his contemporaries despised him,
and led him a cruel life until he obtained food and shelter from
Master Gottfried at the pleasant cost of lessons to the young
Barons.&nbsp; Poor Bastien! this land of quiet, civility, and
books was a foretaste of Paradise to him after the hard living,
barbarity, and coarse vices of his comrades, of whom he now and
then disclosed traits that made his present pupils long to give
battle to the big shaggy youths who used to send out the lesser
lads to beg and steal for them, and cruelly maltreated such as
failed in the quest.</p>
<p>Lessons in music and singing were gladly accepted by both
lads, and from their uncle&rsquo;s carving they could not keep
their hands.&nbsp; Ebbo had begun by enjoining Friedel to
remember that the work that had been sport in the mountains would
be basely mechanical in the city, and Friedel as usual yielded
his private tastes; but on the second day Ebbo himself was
discovered in the workshop, watching the magic touch of the deft
workman, and he was soon so enticed by the perfect appliances as
to take tool in hand and prove himself not unadroit in the
craft.&nbsp; Friedel however excelled in delicacy of touch and
grace and originality of conception, and produced such
workmanship that Master Gottfried could not help stroking his
hair and telling him it was a pity he was not born to belong to
the guild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot spare him, sir,&rdquo; cried Ebbo;
&ldquo;priest, scholar, minstrel, artist&mdash;all want
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Hans of all streets, Ebbo?&rdquo; interrupted
Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And guildmaster of none,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;save
as a warrior; the rest only enough for a gentleman!&nbsp; For
what I am thou must be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ebbo did not find fault with the skill Friedel was
bestowing on his work&mdash;a carving in wood of a dove brooding
over two young eagles&mdash;the device that both were resolved to
assume.&nbsp; When their mother asked what their lady-loves would
say to this, Ebbo looked up, and with the fullest conviction in
his lustrous eyes declared that no love should ever rival his
motherling in his heart.&nbsp; For truly her tender sweetness had
given her sons&rsquo; affection a touch of romance, for which
Master Gottfried liked them the better, though his wife thought
their familiarity with her hardly accordant with the patriarchal
discipline of the citizens.</p>
<p>The youths held aloof from these burghers, for Master
Gottfried wisely desired to give them time to be tamed before
running risk of offence, either to, or by, their wild shy pride;
and their mother contrived to time her meetings with her old
companions when her sons were otherwise occupied.&nbsp; Master
Gottfried made it known that the marriage portion he had designed
for his niece had been intrusted to a merchant trading in peltry
to Muscovy, and the sum thus realized was larger than any bride
had yet brought to Adlerstein.&nbsp; Master Gottfried would have
liked to continue the same profitable speculations with it; but
this would have been beyond the young Baron&rsquo;s endurance,
and his eyes sparkled when his mother spoke of repairing the
castle, refitting the chapel, having a resident chaplain,
cultivating more land, increasing the scanty stock of cattle, and
attempting the improvements hitherto prevented by lack of
means.&nbsp; He fervently declared that the motherling was more
than equal to the wise spinning Queen Bertha of legend and lay;
and the first pleasant sense of wealth came in the acquisition of
horses, weapons, and braveries.&nbsp; In his original mood, Ebbo
would rather have stood before the Diet in his home-spun blue
than have figured in cloth of gold at a burgher&rsquo;s expense;
but he had learned to love his uncle, he regarded the marriage
portion as family property, and moreover he sorely longed to feel
himself and his brother well mounted, and scarcely less to see
his mother in a velvet gown.</p>
<p>Here was his chief point of sympathy with the housemother,
who, herself precluded from wearing miniver, velvet, or pearls,
longed to deck her niece therewith, in time to receive Sir
Kasimir of Adlerstein Wildschloss, as he had promised to meet his
godsons at Ulm.&nbsp; The knight&rsquo;s marriage had lasted only
a few years, and had left him no surviving children except one
little daughter, whom he had placed in a nunnery at Ulm, under
the care of her mother&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; His lands lay higher
up the Danube, and he was expected at Ulm shortly before the
Emperor&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; He had been chiefly in Flanders
with the King of the Romans, and had only returned to Germany
when the Netherlanders had refused the regency of Maximilian, and
driven him out of their country, depriving him of the custody of
his children.</p>
<p>Pfingsttag, or Pentecost-day, was the occasion of
Christina&rsquo;s first full toilet, and never was bride more
solicitously or exultingly arrayed than she, while one boy held
the mirror and the other criticized and admired as the aunt
adjusted the pearl-bordered coif, and long white veil floating
over the long-desired black velvet dress.&nbsp; How the two lads
admired and gazed, caring far less for their own new and noble
attire!&nbsp; Friedel was indeed somewhat concerned that the
sword by his side was so much handsomer than that which Ebbo
wore, and which, for all its dinted scabbard and battered hilt,
he was resolved never to discard.</p>
<p>It was a festival of brilliant joy.&nbsp; Wreaths of flowers
hung from the windows; rich tapestries decked the Dome Kirk, and
the relics were displayed in shrines of wonderful costliness of
material and beauty of workmanship; little birds, with thin cakes
fastened to their feet, were let loose to fly about the church,
in strange allusion to the event of the day; the clergy wore
their most gorgeous robes; and the exulting music of the mass
echoed from the vaults of the long-drawn aisles, and brought a
rapt look of deep calm ecstasy over Friedel&rsquo;s sensitive
features.&nbsp; The beggars evidently considered a festival as a
harvest-day, and crowded round the doors of the cathedral.&nbsp;
As the Lady of Adlerstein came out leaning on Ebbo&rsquo;s arm,
with Friedel on her other side, they evidently attracted the
notice of a woman whose thin brown face looked the darker for the
striped red and yellow silk kerchief that bound the dark locks
round her brow, as, holding out a beringed hand, she fastened her
glittering jet black eyes on them, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Alms! if
the fair dame and knightly Junkern would hear what fate has in
store for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We meddle not with the future, I thank thee,&rdquo;
said Christina, seeing that her sons, to whom gipsies were an
amazing novelty, were in extreme surprise at the fortune-telling
proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet could I tell much, lady,&rdquo; said the woman,
still standing in the way.&nbsp; &ldquo;What would some here
present give to know that the locks that were shrouded by the
widow&rsquo;s veil ere ever they wore the matron&rsquo;s coif
shall yet return to the coif once more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo gave a sudden start of dismay and passion; his mother
held him fast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Push on, Ebbo, mine; heed her not;
she is a mere Bohemian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how knew she your history, mother?&rdquo; asked
Friedel, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be easily learnt at our Wake,&rdquo; began
Christina; but her steps were checked by a call from Master
Gottfried just behind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Frau Freiherrinn, Junkern,
not so fast.&nbsp; Here is your noble kinsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall, fine-looking person, in the long rich robe worn on
peaceful occasions, stood forth, doffing his eagle-plumed bonnet,
and, as the lady turned and curtsied low, he put his knee to the
ground and kissed her hand, saying, &ldquo;Well met, noble dame;
I felt certain that I knew you when I beheld you in the
Dome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was gazing at her all the time,&rdquo; whispered
Ebbo to his brother; while their mother, blushing, replied,
&ldquo;You do me too much honour, Herr Freiherr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once seen, never to be forgotten,&rdquo; was the
courteous answer: &ldquo;and truly, but for the stately height of
these my godsons I would not believe how long since our meeting
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, in true German fashion, Sir Kasimir embraced each
youth in the open street, and then, removing his long,
embroidered Spanish glove, he offered his hand, or rather the
tips of his fingers, to lead the Frau Christina home.</p>
<p>Master Sorel had invited him to become his guest at a very
elaborate ornamental festival meal in honour of the great
holiday, at which were to be present several wealthy citizens
with their wives and families, old connections of the Sorel
family.&nbsp; Ebbo had resolved upon treating them with courteous
reserve and distance; but he was surprised to find his cousin of
Wildschloss comporting himself among the burgomasters and their
dames as freely as though they had been his equals, and to see
that they took such demeanour as perfectly natural.&nbsp; Quick
to perceive, the boy gathered that the gulf between noble and
burgher was so great that no intimacy could bridge it over, no
reserve widen it, and that his own bashful hauteur was almost a
sign that he knew that the gulf had been passed by his own
parents; but shame and consciousness did not enable him to alter
his manner but rather added to its stiffness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Junker is like an Englishman,&rdquo; said Sir
Kasimir, who had met many of the exiles of the Roses at the court
of Mary of Burgundy; and then he turned to discuss with the
guildmasters the interruption to trade caused by Flemish
jealousies.</p>
<p>After the lengthy meal, the tables were removed, the long
gallery was occupied by musicians, and Master Gottfried crossed
the hall to tell his eldest grandnephew that to him he should
depute the opening of the dance with the handsome bride of the
Rathsherr, Ulrich Burger.&nbsp; Ebbo blushed up to the eyes, and
muttered that he prayed his uncle to excuse him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said the old citizen, really displeased;
&ldquo;thy kinsman might have proved to thee that it is no
derogation of thy lordly dignity.&nbsp; I have been patient with
thee, but thy pride passes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; interposed Friedel hastily, raising his
sweet candid face with a look between shame and merriment,
&ldquo;it is not that; but you forget what poor mountaineers we
are.&nbsp; Never did we tread a measure save now and then with
our mother on a winter evening, and we know no more than a
chamois of your intricate measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Gottfried looked perplexed, for these dances were
matters of great punctilio.&nbsp; It was but seven years since
the Lord of Praunstein had defied the whole city of Frankfort
because a damsel of that place had refused to dance with one of
his Cousins; and, though &ldquo;Fistright&rdquo; and letters of
challenge had been made illegal, yet the whole city of Ulm would
have resented the affront put on it by the young lord of
Adlerstein.&nbsp; Happily the Freiherr of Adlerstein Wildschloss
was at hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Herr Burgomaster,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;let me commence the dance with your fair lady niece.&nbsp;
By your testimony,&rdquo; he added, smiling to the youths,
&ldquo;she can tread a measure.&nbsp; And, after marking us, you
may try your success with the Rathsherrinn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina would gladly have transferred her noble partner to
the Rathsherrinn, but she feared to mortify her good uncle and
aunt further, and consented to figure alone with Sir Kasimir in
one of the majestic, graceful dances performed by a single couple
before a gazing assembly.&nbsp; So she let him lead her to her
place, and they bowed and bent, swept past one another, and moved
in interlacing lines and curves, with a grand slow movement that
displayed her quiet grace and his stately port and courtly
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not beautiful to see the motherling?&rdquo; said
Friedel to his brother; &ldquo;she sails like a white cloud in a
soft wind.&nbsp; And he stands grand as a stag at
gaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a malapert peacock, say I,&rdquo; returned Ebbo;
&ldquo;didst not see, Friedel, how he kept his eyes on her in
church?&nbsp; My uncle says the Bohemians are mere
deceivers.&nbsp; Depend on it the woman had spied his insolent
looks when she made her ribald prediction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Friedel, who had been watching the
steps rather than attending, &ldquo;it will be easy to dance it
now.&nbsp; It is a figure my mother once tried to teach us.&nbsp;
I remember it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go and do it, since better may not be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but it should be thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will know which of us it is?&nbsp; I hated his
presumption too much to mark his antics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedel came forward, and the substitution was undetected by
all save their mother and uncle; by the latter only because,
addressing Ebbo, he received a reply in a tone such as Friedel
never used.</p>
<p>Natural grace, quickness of ear and eye, and a skilful
partner, rendered Friedel&rsquo;s so fair a performance that he
ventured on sending his brother to attend the councilloress with
wine and comfits; while he in his own person performed another
dance with the city dame next in pretension, and their mother was
amused by Sir Kasimir&rsquo;s remark, that her second son danced
better than the elder, but both must learn.</p>
<p>The remark displeased Ebbo.&nbsp; In his isolated castle he
knew no superior, and his nature might yield willingly, but
rebelled at being put down.&nbsp; His brother was his perfect
equal in all mental and bodily attributes, but it was the absence
of all self-assertion that made Ebbo so often give him the
preference; it was his mother&rsquo;s tender meekness in which
lay her power with him; and if he yielded to Gottfried
Sorel&rsquo;s wisdom and experience, it was with the inward
consciousness of voluntary deference to one of lower rank.&nbsp;
But here was Wildschloss, of the same noble blood with himself,
his elder, his sponsor, his protector, with every right to direct
him, so that there was no choice between grateful docility and
headstrong folly.&nbsp; If the fellow had been old, weak, or in
any way inferior, it would have been more bearable; but he was a
tried warrior, a sage counsellor, in the prime vigour of manhood,
and with a kindly reasonable authority to which only a fool could
fail to attend, and which for that very reason chafed Ebbo
excessively.</p>
<p>Moreover there was the gipsy prophecy ever rankling in the
lad&rsquo;s heart, and embittering to him the sight of every
civility from his kinsman to his mother.&nbsp; Sir Kasimir lodged
at a neighbouring hostel; but he spent much time with his
cousins, and tried to make them friends with his squire, Count
Rudiger.&nbsp; A great offence to Ebbo was however the criticisms
of both knight and squire on the bearing of the young Barons in
military exercises.&nbsp; Truly, with no instructor but the rough
lanzknecht Heinz, they must, as Friedel said, have been born
paladins to have equalled youths whose life had been spent in
chivalrous training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See us in a downright fight,&rdquo; said Ebbo;
&ldquo;we could strike as hard as any courtly minion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As hard, but scarce as dexterously,&rdquo; said
Friedel, &ldquo;and be called for our pains the wild
mountaineers.&nbsp; I heard the men-at-arms saying I sat my horse
as though it were always going up or down a precipice; and Master
Schmidt went into his shop the other day shrugging his shoulders,
and saying we hailed one another across the market-place as if we
thought Ulm was a mountain full of gemsbocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou heardst! and didst not cast his insolence in his
teeth?&rdquo; cried Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I,&rdquo; laughed Friedel, &ldquo;when the
echo was casting back in my teeth my own shout to thee?&nbsp; I
could only laugh with Rudiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief delight I could have, next to getting home,
would be to lay that fellow Rudiger on his back in the
tilt-yard,&rdquo; said Ebbo.</p>
<p>But, as Rudiger was by four years his senior, and very expert,
the upshot of these encounters was quite otherwise, and the young
gentlemen were disabused of the notion that fighting came by
nature, and found that, if they desired success in a serious
conflict, they must practise diligently in the city tilt-yard,
where young men were trained to arms.&nbsp; The crossbow was the
only weapon with which they excelled; and, as shooting was a
favourite exercise of the burghers, their proficiency was not as
exclusive as had seemed to Ebbo a baronial privilege.&nbsp;
Harquebuses were novelties to them, and they despised them as
burgher weapons, in spite of Sir Kasimir&rsquo;s assurance that
firearms were a great subject of study and interest to the King
of the Romans.&nbsp; The name of this personage was, it may be
feared, highly distasteful to the Freiherr von Adlerstein, both
as Wildschloss&rsquo;s model of knightly perfection, and as one
who claimed submission from his haughty spirit.&nbsp; When Sir
Kasimir spoke to him on the subject of giving his allegiance, he
stiffly replied, &ldquo;Sir, that is a question for ripe
consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the question,&rdquo; said Wildschloss, rather
more lightly than agreed with the Baron&rsquo;s dignity,
&ldquo;whether you like to have your castle pulled down about
your ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That has never happened yet to Adlerstein!&rdquo; said
Ebbo, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, because since the days of the Hohenstaufen there
has been neither rule nor union in the empire.&nbsp; But times
are changing fast, my Junker, and within the last ten years forty
castles such as yours have been consumed by the Swabian League,
as though they were so many walnuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shell of Adlerstein was too hard for them,
though.&nbsp; They never tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wherefore, friend Eberhard?&nbsp; It was because I
represented to the Kaiser and the Graf von Wurtemberg that little
profit and no glory would accrue from attacking a crag full of
women and babes, and that I, having the honour to be your next
heir, should prefer having the castle untouched, and under the
peace of the empire, so long as that peace was kept.&nbsp; When
you should come to years of discretion, then it would be for you
to carry out the intention wherewith your father and grandfather
left home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have been protected by the peace of the empire
all this time?&rdquo; said Friedel, while Ebbo looked as if the
notion were hard of digestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so; and, had you not freely and nobly released
your Genoese merchant, it had gone hard with
Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could Adlerstein be taken?&rdquo; demanded Ebbo
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother thought not,&rdquo; said Sir Kasimir,
with a shade of irony in his tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be a
troublesome siege; but the League numbers 1,500 horse, and 9,000
foot, and, with Schlangenwald&rsquo;s concurrence, you would be
assuredly starved out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo was so much the more stimulated to take his chance, and
do nothing on compulsion; but Friedel put in the question to what
the oaths would bind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to aid the Emperor with sword and counsel in field
or Diet, and thereby win fame and honour such as can scarce be
gained by carrying prey to yon eagle roost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One may preserve one&rsquo;s independence without
robbery,&rdquo; said Ebbo coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lad: did you ever hear of a wolf that could live
without marauding?&nbsp; Or if he tried, would he get credit for
so doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;does not the
present agreement hold till we are of age?&nbsp; I suppose the
Swabian League would attempt nothing against minors, unless we
break the peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not; I will do my utmost to give the Freiherr
there time to grow beyond his grandmother&rsquo;s maxims,&rdquo;
said Wildschloss.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Schlangenwald do not meddle in
the matter, he may have the next five years to decide whether
Adlerstein can hold out against all Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freiherr Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss,&rdquo;
said Eberhard, turning solemnly on him, &ldquo;I do you to wit
once for all that threats will not serve with me.&nbsp; If I
submit, it will be because I am convinced it is right.&nbsp;
Otherwise we had rather both be buried in the ruins of our
castle, as its last free lords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said the provoking kinsman; &ldquo;such
burials look grim when the time comes, but happily it is not
coming yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, as Ebbo said to Friedel, how much might
happen&mdash;a disruption of the empire, a crusade against the
Turks, a war in Italy, some grand means of making the Diet value
the sword of a free baron, without chaining him down to gratify
the greed of hungry Austria.&nbsp; If only Wildschloss could be
shaken off!&nbsp; But he only became constantly more friendly and
intrusive, almost paternal.&nbsp; No wonder, when the mother and
her uncle made him so welcome, and were so intolerably grateful
for his impertinent interference, while even Friedel confessed
the reasonableness of his counsels, as if that were not the very
sting of them.</p>
<p>He even asked leave to bring his little daughter Thekla from
her convent to see the Lady of Adlerstein.&nbsp; She was a
pretty, flaxen-haired maiden of five years old, in a round cap,
and long narrow frock, with a little cross at the neck.&nbsp; She
had never seen any one beyond the walls of the nunnery; and, when
her father took her from the lay sister&rsquo;s arms, and carried
her to the gallery, where sat Hausfrau Johanna, in dark green,
slashed with cherry colour, Master Gottfried, in sober crimson,
with gold medal and chain, Freiherrinn Christina, in
silver-broidered black, and the two Junkern stood near in the
shining mail in which they were going to the tilt yard, she
turned her head in terror, struggled with her scarce known
father, and shrieked for Sister Grethel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all too sheen,&rdquo; she sobbed, in the lay
sister&rsquo;s arms; &ldquo;she did not want to be in Paradise
yet, among the saints!&nbsp; O! take her back!&nbsp; The two
bright, holy Michaels would let her go, for indeed she had made
but one mistake in her Ave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vain was the attempt to make her lift her face from the black
serge shoulder where she had hidden it.&nbsp; Sister Grethel
coaxed and scolded, Sir Kasimir reproved, the housemother offered
comfits, and Christina&rsquo;s soft voice was worst of all, for
the child, probably taking her for Our Lady herself, began to
gasp forth a general confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will never do so
again!&nbsp; Yes, it was a fib, but Mother Hildegard gave me a
bit of marchpane not to tell&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the lay
sister took strong measures for closing the little mouth, and
Christina drew back, recommending that the child should be left
gradually to discover their terrestrial nature.&nbsp; Ebbo had
looked on with extreme disgust, trying to hurry Friedel, who had
delayed to trace some lines for his mother on her broidery
pattern.&nbsp; In passing the step where Grethel sat with Thekla
on her lap, the clank of their armour caused the uplifting of the
little flaxen head, and two wide blue eyes looked over
Grethel&rsquo;s shoulder, and met Friedel&rsquo;s sunny
glance.&nbsp; He smiled; she laughed back again.&nbsp; He held
out his arms, and, though his hands were gauntleted, she let him
lift her up, and curiously smoothed and patted his cheek, as if
he had been a strange animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no wings,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
you St. George, or St. Michael?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither the one nor the other, pretty one.&nbsp; Only
your poor cousin Friedel von Adlerstein, and here is Ebbo, my
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not in Ebbo&rsquo;s nature not to smile encouragement
at the fair little face, with its wistful look.&nbsp; He drew off
his glove to caress her silken hair, and for a few minutes she
was played with by the two brothers like a newly-invented toy,
receiving their attentions with pretty half-frightened
graciousness, until Count Rudiger hastened in to summon them, and
Friedel placed her on his mother&rsquo;s knee, where she speedily
became perfectly happy, and at ease.</p>
<p>Her extreme delight, when towards evening the Junkern
returned, was flattering even to Ebbo; and, when it was time for
her to be taken home, she made strong resistance, clinging fast
to Christina, with screams and struggles.&nbsp; To the
lady&rsquo;s promise of coming to see her she replied,
&ldquo;Friedel and Ebbo, too,&rdquo; and, receiving no response
to this request, she burst out, &ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t
come!&nbsp; I am the Freiherrinn Thekla, the heiress of
Adlerstein Wildschloss and Felsenbach.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t be a
nun.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be married!&nbsp; You shall be my
husband,&rdquo; and she made a dart at the nearest youth, who
happened to be Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, you shall have him.&nbsp; He will come for you,
sweetest Fraulein,&rdquo; said the perplexed Grethel, &ldquo;so
only you will come home!&nbsp; Nobody will come for you if you
are naughty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come if I am good?&rdquo; said the spoilt
cloister pet, clinging tight to Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her father, as she still resisted,
&ldquo;come back, my child, and one day shall you see Ebbo, and
have him for a brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereat Ebbo shook off the little grasping fingers, almost as
if they had belonged to a noxious insect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matron&rsquo;s coif should succeed the
widow&rsquo;s veil.&rdquo;&nbsp; He might talk with scholarly
contempt of the new race of Bohemian impostors; but there was no
forgetting that sentence.&nbsp; And in like manner, though his
grandmother&rsquo;s allegation that his mother had been bent on
captivating Sir Kasimir in that single interview at Adlerstein,
had always seemed to him the most preposterous of all
Kunigunde&rsquo;s forms of outrage, the recollection would recur
to him; and he could have found it in his heart to wish that his
mother had never heard of the old lady&rsquo;s designs as to the
oubliette.&nbsp; He did most sincerely wish Master Gottfried had
never let Wildschloss know of the mode in which his life had been
saved.&nbsp; Yet, while it would have seemed to him profane to
breathe even to Friedel the true secret of his repugnance to this
meddlesome kinsman, it was absolutely impossible to avoid his
most distasteful authority and patronage.</p>
<p>And the mother herself was gently, thankfully happy and
unsuspicious, basking in the tender home affection of which she
had so long been deprived, proud of her sons, and, though anxious
as to Ebbo&rsquo;s decision, with a quiet trust in his foundation
of principle, and above all trusting to prayer.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DOUBLE-HEADED EAGLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> summer evening, when shooting
at a bird on a pole was in full exercise in the tilt-yard, the
sports were interrupted by a message from the Provost that a
harbinger had brought tidings that the Imperial court was within
a day&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>All was preparation.&nbsp; Fresh sand had to be strewn on the
arena.&nbsp; New tapestry hangings were to deck the galleries,
the houses and balconies to be brave with drapery, the fountain
in the market-place was to play Rhine wine, all Ulm was astir to
do honour to itself and to the Kaisar, and Ebbo stood amid all
the bustle, drawing lines in the sand with the stock of his
arblast, subject to all that oppressive self-magnification so
frequent in early youth, and which made it seem to him as if the
Kaisar and the King of the Romans were coming to Ulm with the
mere purpose of destroying his independence, and as if the eyes
of all Germany were watching for his humiliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! see!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Friedel;
&ldquo;look! there is something among the tracery of the Dome
Kirk Tower.&nbsp; Is it man or bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bird, folly!&nbsp; Thou couldst see no bird less than
an eagle from hence,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;No doubt they
are about to hoist a banner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not their wont,&rdquo; returned Sir
Kasimir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; interrupted Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,
but he is a bold climber!&nbsp; We went up to that stage, close
to the balcony, but there&rsquo;s no footing beyond but crockets
and canopies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a bit of rotten scaffold,&rdquo; added
Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps he is a builder going to examine
it!&nbsp; Up higher, higher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A builder!&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;a man with a head
and foot like that should be a chamois hunter!&nbsp; Shouldst
thou deem it worse than the Red Eyrie, Friedel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, truly!&nbsp; The depth beneath is plainer!&nbsp;
There would be no climbing there without&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without what, cousin?&rdquo; asked Wildschloss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without great cause,&rdquo; said Friedel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is fearful!&nbsp; He is like a fly against the
sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beaten again!&rdquo; muttered Ebbo; &ldquo;I did think
that none of these town-bred fellows could surpass us when it
came to a giddy height!&nbsp; Who can he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; burst out Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
saints protect him!&nbsp; He is on that narrowest topmost
ledge&mdash;measuring; his heel is over the parapet&mdash;half
his foot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holding on by the rotten scaffold pole!&nbsp; St.
Barbara be his speed; but he is a brave man!&rdquo; shouted
Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! the pole has broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forefend!&rdquo; cried Wildschloss, with despair
on his face unseen by the boys, for Friedel had hidden his eyes,
and Ebbo was straining his with the intense gaze of horror.&nbsp;
He had carried his glance downwards, following the 380 feet fall
that must be the lot of the adventurer.&nbsp; Then looking up
again he shouted, &ldquo;I see him!&nbsp; I see him!&nbsp; Praise
to St. Barbara!&nbsp; He is safe!&nbsp; He has caught by the
upright stone work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? where?&nbsp; Show me!&rdquo; cried Wildschloss,
grasping Ebbo&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! clinging to that upright bit of tracery,
stretching his foot out to yonder crocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see.&nbsp; Mine eyes swim and dazzle,&rdquo;
said Wildschloss.&nbsp; &ldquo;Merciful heavens! is this another
tempting of Providence?&nbsp; How is it with him now,
Ebbo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swarming down another slender bit of the stone
network.&nbsp; It must be easy now to one who could keep head and
hand steady in such a shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; added Friedel, after a breathless space,
&ldquo;he is on the lower parapet, whence begins the stair.&nbsp;
Do you know him, sir?&nbsp; Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either a Venetian mountebank,&rdquo; said Wildschloss,
&ldquo;or else there is only one man I know of either so
foolhardy or so steady of head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be he who he may,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;he is the
bravest man that ever I beheld.&nbsp; Who is he, Sir
Kasimir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An eagle of higher flight than ours, no doubt,&rdquo;
said Wildschloss.&nbsp; &ldquo;But come; we shall reach the Dome
Kirk by the time the climber has wound his way down the turret
stairs, and we shall see what like he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their coming was well timed, for a small door at the foot of
the tower was just opening to give exit to a very tall knight, in
one of those short Spanish cloaks the collar of which could be
raised so as to conceal the face.&nbsp; He looked to the right
and left, and had one hand raised to put up the collar when he
recognized Sir Kasimir, and, holding out both hands, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Ha, Adlerstein! well met!&nbsp; I looked to see thee
here.&nbsp; No unbonneting; I am not come yet.&nbsp; I am at
Strasburg, with the Kaisar and the Archduke, and am not here till
we ride in, in purple and in pall by the time the good folk have
hung out their arras, and donned their gold chains, and conned
their speeches, and mounted their mules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that their speeches are not over the lykewake of
his kingly kaisarly highness,&rdquo; gravely returned Sir
Kasimir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Thou sawest?&nbsp; I came out here to avoid
the gaping throng, who don&rsquo;t know what a hunter can
do.&nbsp; I have been in worse case in the Tyrol.&nbsp;
Snowdrifts are worse footing than stone vine leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where abides your highness?&rdquo; asked
Wildschloss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ride back again to the halting-place for the night,
and meet my father in time to do my part in the pageant.&nbsp; I
was sick of the addresses, and, moreover, the purse-proud
Flemings have made such a stiff little fop of my poor boy that I
am ashamed to look at him, or hear his French accent.&nbsp; So I
rode off to get a view of this notable Dom in peace, ere it be
bedizened in holiday garb; and one can&rsquo;t stir without all
the Chapter waddling after one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness has found means of distancing
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, truly, the Prior would scarce delight in the view
from yonder parapet,&rdquo; laughed his highness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Adlerstein, where didst get such a perfect pair
of pages?&nbsp; I would I could match my hounds as
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are no pages of mine, so please you,&rdquo; said
the knight; &ldquo;rather this is the head of my name.&nbsp; Let
me present to your kingly highness the Freiherr von
Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou dost not thyself distinguish between them!&rdquo;
said Maximilian, as Friedmund stepped back, putting forward
Eberhard, whose bright, lively smile of interest and admiration
had been the cause of his cousin&rsquo;s mistake.&nbsp; They
would have doffed their caps and bent the knee, but were hastily
checked by Maximilian.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, Junkern, I shall owe
you no thanks for bringing all the street on
me!&mdash;that&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; Reserve the rest for Kaisar
Fritz.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, familiarly taking Sir Kasimir&rsquo;s
arm, he walked on, saying, &ldquo;I remember now.&nbsp; Thou
wentest after an inheritance from the old Mouser of the
Debateable Ford, and wert ousted by a couple of lusty boys sprung
of a peasant wedlock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my lord, of a burgher lady, fair as she is wise
and virtuous; who, spite of all hindrances, has bred up these
youths in all good and noble nurture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this so?&rdquo; said the king, turning sharp round
on the twins.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are ye minded to quit freebooting, and
come a crusading against the Turks with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everywhere with such a leader!&rdquo; enthusiastically
exclaimed Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? up there?&rdquo; said Maximilian, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou hast the tread of a chamois-hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friedel has been on the Red Eyrie,&rdquo; exclaimed
Ebbo; then, thinking he had spoken foolishly, he coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is the Red Eyrie?&rdquo; good-humouredly asked
the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the crag above our castle,&rdquo; said Friedel,
modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other has been there,&rdquo; added Ebbo,
perceiving his auditor&rsquo;s interest; &ldquo;but he saw the
eagle flying away with a poor widow&rsquo;s kid, and the sight
must have given him wings, for we never could find the same path;
but here is one of the feathers he brought
down&rdquo;&mdash;taking off his cap so as to show a feather
rather the worse for wear, and sheltered behind a fresher
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;thou shouldst say that
I came to a ledge where I had like to have stayed all night, but
that ye all came out with men and ropes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know what such a case is!&rdquo; said the
king.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has chanced to us to hang between heaven
and earth; I&rsquo;ve even had the Holy Sacrament held up for my
last pious gaze by those who gave me up for lost on the
mountain-side.&nbsp; Adlerstein?&nbsp; The peak above the
Braunwasser?&nbsp; Some day shall ye show me this eyrie of yours,
and we will see whether we can amaze our cousins the
eagles.&nbsp; We see you at our father&rsquo;s court
to-morrow?&rdquo; he graciously added, and Ebbo gave a ready bow
of acquiescence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the king, as after their dismissal
he walked on with Sir Kasimir, &ldquo;never blame me for rashness
and imprudence.&nbsp; Here has this height of the steeple proved
the height of policy.&nbsp; It has made a loyal subject of a
Mouser on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray Heaven it may have won a heart, true though
proud!&rdquo; said Wildschloss; &ldquo;but mousing was cured
before by the wise training of the mother.&nbsp; Your highness
will have taken out the sting of submission, and you will scarce
find more faithful subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are the Junkern?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some sixteen years, your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what living among mountains does for a
lad.&nbsp; Why could not those thrice-accursed Flemish towns let
me breed up my boy to be good for something in the mountains,
instead of getting duck-footed and muddy-witted in the
fens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Ebbo and Friedel were returning home in that
sort of passion of enthusiasm that ingenuous boyhood feels when
first brought into contact with greatness or brilliant
qualities.</p>
<p>And brilliance was the striking point in Maximilian.&nbsp; The
Last of the Knights, in spite of his many defects, was, by
personal qualities, and the hereditary influence of
long-descended rank, verily a king of men in aspect and
demeanour, even when most careless and simple.&nbsp; He was at
this time a year or two past thirty, unusually tall, and with a
form at once majestic and full of vigour and activity; a noble,
fair, though sunburnt countenance; eyes of dark gray, almost
black; long fair hair, a keen aquiline nose, a lip only beginning
to lengthen to the characteristic Austrian feature, an expression
always lofty, sometimes dreamy, and yet at the same time full of
acuteness and humour.&nbsp; His abilities were of the highest
order, his purposes, especially at this period of his life, most
noble and becoming in the first prince of Christendom; and, if
his life were a failure, and his reputation unworthy of his
endowments, the cause seems to have been in great measure the
bewilderment and confusion that unusual gifts sometimes cause to
their possessor, whose sight their conflicting illumination
dazzles so as to impair his steadiness of aim, while their
contending gleams light him into various directions, so that one
object is deserted for another ere its completion.&nbsp; Thus
Maximilian cuts a figure in history far inferior to that made by
his grandson, Charles V., whom he nevertheless excelled in every
personal quality, except the most needful of all, force of
character; and, in like manner, his remote descendant, the
narrow-minded Ferdinand of Styria, gained his ends, though the
able and brilliant Joseph II. was to die broken-hearted, calling
his reign a failure and mistake.&nbsp; However, such terms as
these could not be applied to Maximilian with regard to home
affairs.&nbsp; He has had hard measure from those who have only
regarded his vacillating foreign policy, especially with respect
to Italy&mdash;ever the temptation and the bane of Austria; but
even here much of his uncertain conduct was owing to the
unfulfilled promises of what he himself called his &ldquo;realm
of kings,&rdquo; and a sovereign can only justly be estimated by
his domestic policy.&nbsp; The contrast of the empire before his
time with the subsequent Germany is that of chaos with
order.&nbsp; Since the death of Friedrich II. the Imperial title
had been a mockery, making the prince who chanced to bear it a
mere mark for the spite of his rivals; there was no centre of
justice, no appeal; everybody might make war on everybody, with
the sole preliminary of exchanging a challenge;
&ldquo;fist-right&rdquo; was the acknowledged law of the land;
and, except in the free cities, and under such a happy accident
as a right-minded prince here and there, the state of Germany
seems to have been rather worse than that of Scotland from Bruce
to the union of the Crowns.&nbsp; Under Maximilian, the Diet
became an effective council, fist-right was abolished,
independent robber-lords put down, civilization began to effect
an entrance, the system of circles was arranged, and the empire
again became a leading power in Europe, instead of a mere vortex
of disorder and misrule.&nbsp; Never would Charles V. have held
the position he occupied had he come after an ordinary man,
instead of after an able and sagacious reformer like that
Maximilian who is popularly regarded as a fantastic caricature of
a knight-errant, marred by avarice and weakness of purpose.</p>
<p>At the juncture of which we are writing, none of
Maximilian&rsquo;s less worthy qualities had appeared; he had not
been rendered shifty and unscrupulous by difficulties and
disappointments in money matters, and had not found it impossible
to keep many of the promises he had given in all good
faith.&nbsp; He stood forth as the hope of Germany, in salient
contrast to the feeble and avaricious father, who was felt to be
the only obstacle in the way of his noble designs of establishing
peace and good discipline in the empire, and conducting a general
crusade against the Turks, whose progress was the most
threatening peril of Christendom.&nbsp; His fame was, of course,
frequently discussed among the citizens, with whom he was very
popular, not only from his ease and freedom of manner, but
because his graceful tastes, his love of painting, sculpture,
architecture, and the mechanical turn which made him an improver
of fire-arms and a patron of painting and engraving, rendered
their society more agreeable to him than that of his dull,
barbarous nobility.&nbsp; Ebbo had heard so much of the
perfections of the King of the Romans as to be prepared to hate
him; but the boy, as we have seen, was of a generous, sensitive
nature, peculiarly prone to enthusiastic impressions of
veneration; and Maximilian&rsquo;s high-spirited manhood,
personal fascination, and individual kindness had so entirely
taken him by surprise, that he talked of him all the evening in a
more fervid manner than did even Friedel, though both could
scarcely rest for their anticipations of seeing him on the morrow
in the full state of his entry.</p>
<p>Richly clad, and mounted on cream-coloured steeds, nearly as
much alike as themselves, the twins were a pleasant sight for a
proud mother&rsquo;s eyes, as they rode out to take their place
in the procession that was to welcome the royal guests.&nbsp;
Master Sorel, in ample gown, richly furred, with medal and chain
of office, likewise went forth as Guildmaster; and Christina,
with smiling lips and liquid eyes, recollected the days when to
see him in such array was her keenest pleasure, and the utmost
splendour her fancy could depict.</p>
<p>Arrayed, as her sons loved to see her, in black velvet, and
with pearl-bordered cap, Christina sat by her aunt in the
tapestried balcony, and between them stood or sat little Thekla
von Adlerstein Wildschloss, whose father had entrusted her to
their care, to see the procession pass by.&nbsp; A rich Eastern
carpet, of gorgeous colouring, covered the upper balustrade, over
which they leant, in somewhat close quarters with the
scarlet-bodiced dames of the opposite house, but with ample space
for sight up and down the rows of smiling expectants at each
balcony, or window, equally gay with hangings, while the bells of
all the churches clashed forth their gayest chimes, and fitful
bursts of music were borne upon the breeze.&nbsp; Little Thekla
danced in the narrow space for very glee, and wondered why any
one should live in a cloister when the world was so wide and so
fair.&nbsp; And Dame Johanna tried to say something pious of
worldly temptations, and the cloister shelter; but Thekla
interrupted her, and, clinging to Christina, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Nay, but I am always naughty with Mother Ludmilla in the
convent, and I know I should never be naughty out here with you
and the barons; I should be so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush! little one; here they come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On they came&mdash;stout lanzknechts first, the city guard
with steel helmets unadorned, buff suits, and bearing either
harquebuses, halberts, or those handsome but terrible weapons,
morning stars.&nbsp; Then followed guild after guild, each
preceded by the banner bearing its homely emblem&mdash;the
cauldron of the smiths, the hose of the clothiers, the helmet of
the armourers, the bason of the barbers, the boot of the sutors;
even the sausage of the cooks, and the shoe of the shoeblacks,
were re-presented, as by men who gloried in the calling in which
they did life&rsquo;s duty and task.</p>
<p>First in each of these bands marched the prentices, stout,
broad, flat-faced lads, from twenty to fourteen years of age,
with hair like tow hanging from under their blue caps, staves in
their hands, and knives at their girdles.&nbsp; Behind them came
the journeymen, in leathern jerkins and steel caps, and armed
with halberts or cross-bows; men of all ages, from sixty to one
or two and twenty, and many of the younger ones with foreign
countenances and garb betokening that they were strangers
spending part of their wandering years in studying the Ulm
fashions of their craft.&nbsp; Each trade showed a large array of
these juniors; but the masters who came behind were comparatively
few, mostly elderly, long-gowned, gold-chained personages, with a
weight of solid dignity on their wise brows&mdash;men who
respected themselves, made others respect them, and kept their
city a peaceful, well-ordered haven, while storms raged in the
realm beyond&mdash;men too who had raised to the glory of their
God a temple, not indeed fulfilling the original design, but a
noble effort, and grand monument of burgher devotion.</p>
<p>Then came the ragged regiment of scholars, wild lads from
every part of Germany and Switzerland, some wan and pinched with
hardship and privation, others sturdy, selfish rogues, evidently
well able to take care of themselves.&nbsp; There were many rude,
tyrannical-looking lads among the older lads; and, though here
and there a studious, earnest face might be remarked, the
prospect of Germany&rsquo;s future priests and teachers was not
encouraging.&nbsp; And what a searching ordeal was awaiting those
careless lads when the voice of one, as yet still a student,
should ring through Germany!</p>
<p>Contrasting with these ill-kempt pupils marched the grave
professors and teachers, in square ecclesiastic caps and long
gowns, whose colours marked their degrees and the Universities
that had conferred them&mdash;some thin, some portly, some
jocund, others dreamy; some observing all the humours around,
others still intent on Aristotelian ethics; all men of high fame,
with doctor at the beginning of their names, and &ldquo;or&rdquo;
or &ldquo;us&rdquo; at the close of them.&nbsp; After them rode
the magistracy, a burgomaster from each guild, and the Herr
Provost himself&mdash;as great a potentate within his own walls
as the Doge of Venice or of Genoa, or perhaps greater, because
less jealously hampered.&nbsp; In this dignified group was Uncle
Gottfried, by complacent nod and smile acknowledging his good
wife and niece, who indeed had received many a previous glance
and bow from friends passing beneath.&nbsp; But Master Sorel was
no new spectacle in a civic procession, and the sight of him was
only a pleasant fillip to the excitement of his ladies.</p>
<p>Here was jingling of spurs and trampling of horses; heraldic
achievements showed upon the banners, round which rode the
mail-clad retainers of country nobles who had mustered to meet
their lords.&nbsp; Then, with still more of clank and tramp, rode
a bright-faced troop of lads, with feathered caps and gay
mantles.&nbsp; Young Count Rudiger looked up with courteous
salutation; and just behind him, with smiling lips and upraised
faces, were the pair whose dark eyes, dark hair, and slender
forms rendered them conspicuous among the fair Teutonic
youth.&nbsp; Each cap was taken off and waved, and each pair of
lustrous eyes glanced up pleasure and exultation at the sight of
the lovely &ldquo;Mutterlein.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she?&nbsp; The
pageant was well-nigh over to her, save for heartily agreeing
with Aunt Johanna that there was not a young noble of them all to
compare with the twin Barons of Adlerstein!&nbsp; However, she
knew she should be called to account if she did not look well at
&ldquo;the Romish King;&rdquo; besides, Thekla was shrieking with
delight at the sight of her father, tall and splendid on his
mighty black charger, with a smile for his child, and for the
lady a bow so low and deferential that it was evidently remarked
by those at whose approach every lady in the balconies was
rising, every head in the street was bared.</p>
<p>A tall, thin, shrivelled, but exceedingly stately old man on a
gray horse was in the centre.&nbsp; Clad in a purple velvet
mantle, and bowing as he went, he looked truly the Kaisar, to
whom stately courtesy was second nature.&nbsp; On one side, in
black and gold, with the jewel of the Golden Fleece on his
breast, rode Maximilian, responding gracefully to the salutations
of the people, but his keen gray eye roving in search of the
object of Sir Kasimir&rsquo;s salute, and lighting on Christina
with such a rapid, amused glance of discovery that, in her
confusion, she missed what excited Dame Johanna&rsquo;s rapturous
admiration&mdash;the handsome boy on the Emperor&rsquo;s other
side, a fair, plump lad, the young sovereign of the Low
Countries, beautiful in feature and complexion, but lacking the
fire and the loftiness that characterized his father&rsquo;s
countenance.&nbsp; The train was closed by the Reitern of the
Emperor&rsquo;s guard&mdash;steel-clad mercenaries who were
looked on with no friendly eyes by the few gazers in the street
who had been left behind in the general rush to keep up with the
attractive part of the show.</p>
<p>Pageants of elaborate mythological character impeded the
imperial progress at every stage, and it was full two hours ere
the two youths returned, heartily weary of the lengthened
ceremonial, and laughing at having actually seen the King of the
Romans enduring to be conducted from shrine to shrine in the
cathedral by a large proportion of its dignitaries.&nbsp; Ebbo
was sure he had caught an archly disconsolate wink!</p>
<p>Ebbo had to dress for the banquet spread in the
town-hall.&nbsp; Space was wanting for the concourse of guests,
and Master Sorel had decided that the younger Baron should not be
included in the invitation.&nbsp; Friedel pardoned him more
easily than did Ebbo, who not only resented any slight to his
double, but in his fits of shy pride needed the aid of his
readier and brighter other self.&nbsp; But it might not be, and
Sir Kasimir and Master Gottfried alone accompanied him, hoping
that he would not look as wild as a hawk, and would do nothing to
diminish the favourable impression he had made on the King of the
Romans.</p>
<p>Late, according to medi&aelig;val hours, was the return, and
Ebbo spoke in a tone of elation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Kaisar was most
gracious, and the king knew me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and asked
for thee, Friedel, saying one of us was nought without the
other.&nbsp; But thou wilt go to-morrow, for we are to receive
knighthood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already!&rdquo; exclaimed Friedel, a bright glow
rushing to his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Romish king
said somewhat about waiting to win our spurs; but the Kaisar said
I was in a position to take rank as a knight, and I thanked him,
so thou shouldst share the honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kaisar,&rdquo; said Wildschloss, &ldquo;is not the
man to let a knight&rsquo;s fee slip between his fingers.&nbsp;
The king would have kept off their grip, and reserved you for
knighthood from his own sword under the banner of the empire; but
there is no help for it now, and you must make your vassals send
in their dues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My vassals?&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;what could they
send?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aid customary on the knighthood of the
heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is&mdash;there is nothing!&rdquo; said
Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;They can scarce pay meal and poultry enough
for our daily fare; and if we were to flay them alive, we should
not get sixty groschen from the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough!&nbsp; Knighthood must wait till we win
it,&rdquo; said Ebbo, gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, it is accepted,&rdquo; said Wildschloss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Kaisar loves his iron chest too well to let you go
back.&nbsp; You must be ready with your round sum to the
chancellor, and your spur-money and your fee to the heralds, and
largess to the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, the dowry,&rdquo; said Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service, my son,&rdquo; said Christina, anxious
to chase the cloud from his brow.</p>
<p>But it was a deep haul, for the avaricious Friedrich IV. made
exorbitant charges for the knighting his young nobles; and Ebbo
soon saw that the improvements at home must suffer for the
honours that would have been so much better won than bought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your vassals cannot aid, yet may not your
kinsman&mdash;?&rdquo; began Wildschloss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; interrupted Ebbo, lashed up to hot
indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir!&nbsp; Rather will my mother,
brother, and I ride back this very night to unfettered liberty on
our mountain, without obligation to any living man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less hotly, Sir Baron,&rdquo; said Master Gottfried,
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You broke in on your noble godfather, and
you had not heard me speak.&nbsp; You and your brother are the
old man&rsquo;s only heirs, nor do ye incur any obligation that
need fret you by forestalling what would be your just
right.&nbsp; I will see my nephews as well equipped as any young
baron of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother looked anxiously at Ebbo.&nbsp; He bent his head
with rising colour, and said, &ldquo;Thanks, kind uncle.&nbsp;
From <i>you</i> I have learnt to look on goodness as
fatherly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; added Friedel, &ldquo;if the Baron&rsquo;s
station renders knighthood fitting for him, surely I might remain
his esquire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Friedel!&rdquo; cried his brother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Without thee, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, Freiherr,&rdquo; said Master Sorel;
&ldquo;what becomes the one becomes the other.&nbsp; I would not
have thee left out, my Friedel, since I cannot leave thee the
mysteries of my craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; said Friedel, gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then must the vigil be kept to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy thinks these are the days of Roland and Karl
the Great,&rdquo; said Wildschloss.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would fain
watch his arms in the moonlight in the Dome Kirk!&nbsp; Alas! no,
my Friedel!&nbsp; Knighthood in these days smacks more of bezants
than of deeds of prowess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbearable fellow!&rdquo; cried Ebbo, when he had
latched the door of the room he shared with his brother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;First, holding up my inexperience to scorn!&nbsp; As
though the Kaisar knew not better than he what befits me!&nbsp;
Then trying to buy my silence and my mother&rsquo;s gratitude
with his hateful advance of gold.&nbsp; As if I did not loathe
him enough without!&nbsp; If I pay my homage, and sign the League
to-morrow, it will be purely that he may not plume himself on our
holding our own by sufferance, in deference to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will sign it&mdash;you will do homage!&rdquo;
exclaimed Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;How rejoiced the mother will
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had rather depend at once&mdash;if depend I
must&mdash;on yonder dignified Kaisar and that noble king than on
our meddling kinsman,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall be
his equal now!&nbsp; Ay, and no more classed with the court
Junkern I was with to-day.&nbsp; The dullards!&nbsp; No one
reasonable thing know they but the chase.&nbsp; One had been at
Florence; and when I asked him of the Baptistery and rare Giotto
of whom my uncle told us, he asked if he were a knight of the
Medici.&nbsp; All he knew was that there were ortolans at Ser
Lorenzo&rsquo;s table; and he and the rest of them talked over
wines as many and as hard to call as the roll of
&AElig;neas&rsquo;s comrades; and when each one must drink to her
he loved best, and I said I loved none like my sweet mother, they
gibed me for a simple dutiful mountaineer.&nbsp; Yea, and when
the servants brought a bowl, I thought it was a wholesome draught
of spring water after all their hot wines and fripperies.&nbsp;
Pah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rose-water, Ebbo!&nbsp; No wonder they
laughed!&nbsp; Why, the bowls for our fingers came round at the
banquet here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! thou hast eyes for their finikin manners!&nbsp; Yet
what know they of what we used to long for in polished
life!&nbsp; Not one but vowed he abhorred books, and cursed Dr.
Faustus for multiplying them.&nbsp; I may not know the taste of a
stew, nor the fit of a glove, as they do, but I trust I bear a
less empty brain.&nbsp; And the young Netherlanders that came
with the Archduke were worst of all.&nbsp; They got together and
gabbled French, and treated the German Junkern with the very same
sauce with which they had served me.&nbsp; The Archduke laughed
with them, and when the Provost addressed him, made as if he
understood not, till his father heard, and thundered out,
&lsquo;How now, Philip!&nbsp; Deaf on thy German ear?&nbsp; I
tell thee, Herr Probst, he knows his own tongue as well as thou
or I, and thou shalt hear him speak as becomes the son of an
Austrian hunter.&rsquo;&nbsp; That Romish king is a knight of
knights, Friedel.&nbsp; I could follow him to the world&rsquo;s
end.&nbsp; I wonder whether he will ever come to climb the Red
Eyrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not seem the world&rsquo;s end when one is
there,&rdquo; said Friedel, with strange yearnings in his
breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the Dom steeple never rose to its full
height,&rdquo; he added, standing in the window, and gazing
pensively into the summer sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Ebbo! this
knighthood has come very suddenly after our many dreams; and,
even though its outward tokens be lowered, it is still a holy,
awful thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurtured in mountain solitude, on romance transmitted through
the pure medium of his mother&rsquo;s mind, and his spirit
untainted by contact with the world, Friedmund von Adlerstein
looked on chivalry with the temper of a Percival or Galahad, and
regarded it with a sacred awe.&nbsp; Eberhard, though treating it
more as a matter of business, was like enough to his brother to
enter into the force of the vows they were about to make; and if
the young Barons of Adlerstein did not perform the night-watch
over their armour, yet they kept a vigil that impressed their own
minds as deeply, and in early morn they went to confession and
mass ere the gay parts of the city were astir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet niece,&rdquo; said Master Sorel, as he saw the
brothers&rsquo; grave, earnest looks, &ldquo;thou hast done well
by these youths; yet I doubt me at times whether they be not too
much lifted out of this veritable world of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, fair uncle, were they not above it, how could they
face its temptations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, my child; but how will it be when they find how
lightly others treat what to them is so solemn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be temptations for them, above all for
Ebbo,&rdquo; said Christina, &ldquo;but still, when I remember
how my heart sank when their grandmother tried to bring them up
to love crime as sport and glory, I cannot but trust that the
good work will be wrought out, and my dream fulfilled, that they
may be lights on earth and stars in heaven.&nbsp; Even this
matter of homage, that seemed so hard to my Ebbo, has now been
made easy to him by his veneration for the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was even so.&nbsp; If the sense that he was the last
veritable <i>free</i> lord of Adlerstein rushed over Ebbo, he
was, on the other hand, overmastered by the kingliness of
Friedrich and Maximilian, and was aware that this submission,
while depriving him of little or no actual power, brought him
into relations with the civilized world, and opened to him paths
of true honour.&nbsp; So the ceremonies were gone through, his
oath of allegiance was made, investiture was granted to him by
the delivery of a sword, and both he and Friedel were dubbed
knights.&nbsp; Then they shared another banquet, where, as away
from the Junkern and among elder men, Ebbo was happier than the
day before.&nbsp; Some of the knights seemed to him as rude and
ignorant as the Schneiderlein, but no one talked to him nor
observed his manners, and he could listen to conversation on war
and policy such as interested him far more than the subjects
affected by youths a little older than himself.&nbsp; Their
lonely life and training had rendered the minds of the brothers
as much in advance of their fellows as they were behind them in
knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>The crass obtuseness of most of the nobility made it a relief
to return to the usual habits of the Sorel household when the
court had left Ulm.&nbsp; Friedmund, anxious to prove that his
new honours were not to alter his home demeanour, was drawing on
a block of wood from a tinted pen-and-ink sketch; Ebbo was deeply
engaged with a newly-acquired copy of Virgil; and their mother
was embroidering some draperies for the long-neglected castle
chapel,&mdash;all sitting, as Master Gottfried loved to have
them, in his studio, whence he had a few moments before been
called away, when, as the door slowly opened, a voice was heard
that made both lads start and rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, truly, Herr Guildmaster, I would see these
masterpieces.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; What have you here for
masterpieces?&nbsp; Our two new double-ganger
knights?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Maximilian entered in a simple
riding-dress, attended by Master Gottfried, and by Sir Kasimir of
Adlerstein Wildschloss.</p>
<p>Christina would fain have slipped out unperceived, but the
king was already removing his cap from his fair curling locks,
and bending his head as he said, &ldquo;The Frau Freiherrinn von
Adlerstein?&nbsp; Fair lady, I greet you well, and thank you in
the Kaisar&rsquo;s name and mine for having bred up for us two
true and loyal subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May they so prove themselves, my liege!&rdquo; said
Christina, bending low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not only loyal-hearted,&rdquo; added Maximilian,
smiling, &ldquo;but ready-brained, which is less frequent among
our youth.&nbsp; What is thy book, young knight?&nbsp; Virgilius
Maro?&nbsp; Dost thou read the Latin?&rdquo; he added, in that
tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as well as we wish, your kingly highness,&rdquo;
readily answered Ebbo, in Latin, &ldquo;having learnt solely of
our mother till we came hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear for that, my young blade,&rdquo; laughed the
king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowst not that the wiseacres thought me too
dull for teaching till I was past ten years?&nbsp; And what is
thy double about?&nbsp; Drawing on wood?&nbsp; How now!&nbsp; An
able draughtsman, my young knight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nephew Sir Friedmund is good to the old man,&rdquo;
said Gottfried, himself almost regretting the lad&rsquo;s
avocation.&nbsp; &ldquo;My eyes are failing me, and he is aiding
me with the graving of this border.&nbsp; He has the knack that
no teaching will impart to any of my present
journeymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born, not made,&rdquo; quoth Maximilian.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; as Friedel coloured deeper at the sense that
Ebbo was ashamed of him, &ldquo;no blushes, my boy; it is a rare
gift.&nbsp; I can make a hundred knights any day, but the
Almighty alone can make a genius.&nbsp; It was this very matter
of graving that led me hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Maximilian had a passion for composition, and chiefly for
autobiography, and his head was full of that curious performance,
<i>Der Weisse K&ouml;nig</i>, which occupied many of the leisure
moments of his life, being dictated to his former writing-master,
Marcus Sauerwein.&nbsp; He had already designed the portrayal of
his father as the old white king, and himself as the young white
king, in a series of woodcuts illustrating the narrative which
culminated in the one romance of his life, his brief happy
marriage with Mary of Burgundy; and he continued eagerly to talk
to Master Gottfried about the mystery of graving, and the various
scenes in which he wished to depict himself learning languages
from native speakers&mdash;Czech from a peasant with a basket of
eggs, English from the exiles at the Burgundian court, who had
also taught him the use of the longbow, building from architects
and masons, painting from artists, and, more imaginatively,
astrology from a wonderful flaming sphere in the sky, and the
black art from a witch inspired by a long-tailed demon perched on
her shoulder.&nbsp; No doubt &ldquo;the young white king&rdquo;
made an exceedingly prominent figure in the discourse, but it was
so quaint and so brilliant that it did not need the charm of
royal condescension to entrance the young knights, who stood
silent auditors.&nbsp; Ebbo at least was convinced that no
species of knowledge or skill was viewed by his kaisarly kingship
as beneath his dignity; but still he feared Friedel&rsquo;s being
seized upon to be as prime illustrator to the royal
autobiography&mdash;a lot to which, with all his devotion to
Maximilian, he could hardly have consigned his brother, in the
certainty that the jeers of the ruder nobles would pursue the
craftsman baron.</p>
<p>However, for the present, Maximilian was keen enough to see
that the boy&rsquo;s mechanical skill was not as yet equal to his
genius; so he only encouraged him to practise, adding that he
heard there was a rare lad, one D&uuml;rer, at Nuremburg, whose
productions were already wonderful.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what is
this?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;what is the daintily-carved group I
see yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your highness means, &lsquo;The Dove in the
Eagle&rsquo;s Nest,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Kasimir.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is the work of my young kinsmen, and their appropriate
device.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well chosen as carved,&rdquo; said Maximilian,
examining it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well is it that a city dove should now
and then find her way to the eyrie.&nbsp; Some of my nobles would
cut my throat for the heresy, but I am safe here, eh, Sir
Kasimir?&nbsp; Fare ye well, ye dove-trained eaglets.&nbsp; We
will know one another better when we bear the cross against the
infidel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers kissed his hand, and he descended the steps from
the hall door.&nbsp; Ere he had gone far, he turned round upon
Sir Kasimir with a merry smile: &ldquo;A very white and tender
dove indeed, and one who might easily nestle in another eyrie,
methinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deems your kingly highness that consent could be
won?&rdquo; asked Wildschloss</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the Kaisar?&nbsp; Pfui, man, thou knowst as well
as I do the golden key to his consent.&nbsp; So thou wouldst risk
thy luck again!&nbsp; Thou hast no male heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I would fain give my child a mother who would deal
well with her.&nbsp; Nay, to say sooth, that gentle, innocent
face has dwelt with me for many years.&nbsp; But for my
pre-contract, I had striven long ago to win her, and had been a
happier man, mayhap.&nbsp; And, now I have seen what she has made
of her sons, I feel I could scarce find her match among our
nobility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor elsewhere,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;and I
honour thee for not being so besotted in our German haughtiness
as not to see that it is our free cities that make refined and
discreet dames.&nbsp; I give you good speed, Adlerstein; but, if
I read aright the brow of one at least of these young fellows,
thou wilt scarce have a willing or obedient stepson.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE RIVAL EYRIE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ebbo</span> trusted that his kinsman of
Wildschloss was safe gone with the Court, and his temper smoothed
and his spirits rose in proportion while preparations for a
return to Adlerstein were being completed&mdash;preparations by
which the burgher lady might hope to render the castle far more
habitable, not to say baronial, than it had ever been.</p>
<p>The lady herself felt thankful that her stay at Ulm had turned
out well beyond all anticipations in the excellent understanding
between her uncle and her sons, and still more in Ebbo&rsquo;s
full submission and personal loyalty towards the imperial
family.&nbsp; The die was cast, and the first step had been taken
towards rendering the Adlerstein family the peaceful, honourable
nobles she had always longed to see them.</p>
<p>She was one afternoon assisting her aunt in some of the duties
of her wirthschaft, when Master Gottfried entered the apartment
with an air of such extreme complacency that both turned round
amazed; the one exclaiming, &ldquo;Surely funds have come in for
finishing the spire!&rdquo; the other, &ldquo;Have they appointed
thee Provost for next year, house-father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither the one nor the other,&rdquo; was the
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;But heard you not the horse&rsquo;s
feet?&nbsp; Here has the Lord of Adlerstein Wildschloss been with
me in full state, to make formal proposals for the hand of our
child, Christina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Christina!&rdquo; cried Hausfrau Johanna with
delight; &ldquo;truly that is well.&nbsp; Truly our maiden has
done honour to her breeding.&nbsp; A second nobleman demanding
her&mdash;and one who should be able richly to endow
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who will do so,&rdquo; said Master Gottfried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For morning gift he promises the farms and lands of
Gr&uuml;nau&mdash;rich both in forest and corn glebe.&nbsp;
Likewise, her dower shall be upon Wildschloss&mdash;where the
soil is of the richest pasture, and there are no less than three
mills, whence the lord obtains large rights of multure.&nbsp;
Moreover, the Castle was added to and furnished on his marriage
with the late baroness, and might serve a Kurf&uuml;rst; and
though the jewels of Freiherrinn Valeska must be inherited by her
daughter, yet there are many of higher price which have descended
from his own ancestresses, and which will all be hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a wedding we will have!&rdquo; exclaimed
Johanna; &ldquo;it shall be truly baronial.&nbsp; I will take my
hood and go at once to neighbour Sophie Lemsberg, who was wife to
the Markgraf&rsquo;s Under Keller-Meister.&nbsp; She will tell me
point device the ceremonies befitting the espousals of a
baron&rsquo;s widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Christina had sat all this time with drooping head and
clasped hands, a tear stealing down as the formal terms of the
treaty sent her spirit back to the urgent, pleading, imperious
voice that had said, &ldquo;Now, little one, thou wilt not shut
me out;&rdquo; and as she glanced at the ring that had lain on
that broad palm, she felt as if her sixteen cheerful years had
been an injury to her husband in his nameless bloody grave.&nbsp;
But protection was so needful in those rude ages, and second
marriages so frequent, that reluctance was counted as
weakness.&nbsp; She knew her uncle and aunt would never believe
that aught but compulsion had bound her to the rude outlaw, and
her habit of submission was so strong that, only when her aunt
was actually rising to go and consult her gossip, she found
breath to falter,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, dear aunt&mdash;my sons&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, child, it is the best thing thou couldst do for
them.&nbsp; Wonders hast thou wrought, yet are they too old to be
without fatherly authority.&nbsp; I speak not of Friedel; the lad
is gentle and pious, though spirited, but for the baron.&nbsp;
The very eye and temper of my poor brother Hugh&mdash;thy father,
Stine&mdash;are alive again in him.&nbsp; Yea, I love the lad the
better for it, while I fear.&nbsp; He minds me precisely of Hugh
ere he was &rsquo;prenticed to the weapon-smith, and all became
bitterness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, truly,&rdquo; said Christina, raising her eyes
&ldquo;all would become bitterness with my Ebbo were I to give a
father&rsquo;s power to one whom he would not love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then were he sullen and unruly, indeed!&rdquo; said the
old burgomaster with displeasure; &ldquo;none have shown him more
kindness, none could better aid him in court and empire.&nbsp;
The lad has never had restraint enough.&nbsp; I blame thee not,
child, but he needs it sorely, by thine own showing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, uncle! mine be the blame, but it is over
late.&nbsp; My boy will rule himself for the love of God and of
his mother, but he will brook no hand over him&mdash;least of all
now he is a knight and thinks himself a man.&nbsp; Uncle, I
should be deprived of both my sons, for Friedel&rsquo;s very soul
is bound up with his brother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I pray thee enjoin
not this thing on me,&rdquo; she implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child!&rdquo; exclaimed Master Gottfried, &ldquo;thou
thinkst not that such a contract as this can be declined for the
sake of a wayward Junker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, house-father, the little one will doubtless hear
reason and submit,&rdquo; put in the aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her sons
were goodly and delightsome to her in their upgrowth, but they
are well-nigh men.&nbsp; They will be away to court and camp, to
love and marriage; and how will it be with her then, young and
fair as she still is?&nbsp; Well will it be for her to have a
stately lord of her own, and a new home of love and honour
springing round her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; continued Sorel; &ldquo;and though she be
too pious and wise to reck greatly of such trifles, yet it may
please her dreamy brain to hear that Sir Kasimir loves her even
like a paladin, and the love of a tried man of six-and-forty is
better worth than a mere kindling of youthful fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine Eberhard loved me!&rdquo; murmured Christina,
almost to herself, but her aunt caught the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was such love worth?&nbsp; To force thee into
a stolen match, and leave thee alone and unowned to the
consequences!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; exclaimed Christina, with crimson cheek
and uplifted head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace!&nbsp; My own dear lord
loved me with true and generous love!&nbsp; None but myself knows
how much.&nbsp; Not a word will I hear against that tender
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, peace,&rdquo; returned Gottfried in a conciliatory
tone,&mdash;&ldquo;peace to the brave Sir Eberhard.&nbsp; Thine
aunt meant no ill of him.&nbsp; He truly would rejoice that the
wisdom of his choice should receive such testimony, and that his
sons should be thus well handled.&nbsp; Nay, little as I heed
such toys, it will doubtless please the lads that the baron will
obtain of the Emperor letters of nobility for this house, which
verily sprang of a good Walloon family, and so their shield will
have no blank.&nbsp; The Romish king promises to give thee rank
with any baroness, and hath fully owned what a pearl thou art,
mine own sweet dove!&nbsp; Nay, Sir Kasimir is coming to-morrow
in the trust to make the first betrothal with Graf von Kaulwitz
as a witness, and I thought of asking the Provost on the other
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; exclaimed Johanna; &ldquo;and how is
she to be meetly clad?&nbsp; Look at this widow-garb; and how is
time to be found for procuring other raiment?&nbsp; House-father,
a substantial man like you should better understand!&nbsp; The
meal too!&nbsp; I must to gossip Sophie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, dear mother and father,&rdquo; said Christina,
who had rallied a little, &ldquo;have patience with me.&nbsp; I
may not lightly or suddenly betroth myself; I know not that I can
do so at all, assuredly not unless my sons were heartily
willing.&nbsp; Have I your leave to retire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted, my child, for meditation will show thee that
this is too fair a lot for any but thee.&nbsp; Much had I longed
to see thee wedded ere thy sons outgrew thy care, but I shunned
proposing even one of our worthy guildmasters, lest my young
Freiherr should take offence; but this knight, of his own blood,
true and wise as a burgher, and faithful and God-fearing withal,
is a better match than I durst hope, and is no doubt a special
reward from thy patron saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me entreat one favour more,&rdquo; implored
Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak of this to no one ere I have seen
my sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made her way to her own chamber, there to weep and
flutter.&nbsp; Marriage was a matter of such high contract
between families that the parties themselves had usually no voice
in the matter, and only the widowed had any chance of a personal
choice; nor was this always accorded in the case of females, who
remained at the disposal of their relatives.&nbsp; Good
substantial wedded affection was not lacking, but romantic love
was thought an unnecessary preliminary, and found a vent in
extravagant adoration, not always in reputable quarters.&nbsp;
Obedience first to the father, then to the husband, was the first
requisite; love might shift for itself; and the fair widow of
Adlerstein, telling her beads in sheer perplexity, knew not
whether her strong repugnance to this marriage and warm sympathy
with her son Ebbo were not an act of rebellion.&nbsp; Yet each
moment did her husband rise before her mind more vividly, with
his rugged looks, his warm, tender heart, his dawnings of
comprehension, his generous forbearance and reverential
love&mdash;the love of her youth&mdash;to be equalled by no
other.&nbsp; The accomplished courtier and polished man of the
world might be his superior, but she loathed the superiority,
since it was to her husband.&nbsp; Might not his one chosen dove
keep heart-whole for him to the last?&nbsp; She recollected that
coarsest, cruellest reproach of all that her mother-in-law had
been wont to fling at her,&mdash;that she, the recent widow, the
new-made mother of Eberhard&rsquo;s babes, in her grief, her
terror, and her weakness had sought to captivate this suitor by
her blandishments.&nbsp; The taunt seemed justified, and her
cheeks burned with absolute shame &ldquo;My husband! my loving
Eberhard! left with none but me to love thee, unknown to thine
own sons!&nbsp; I cannot, I will not give my heart away from
thee!&nbsp; Thy little bride shall be faithful to thee, whatever
betide.&nbsp; When we meet beyond the grave I will have been
thine only, nor have set any before thy sons.&nbsp; Heaven
forgive me if I be undutiful to my uncle; but thou must be
preferred before even him!&nbsp; Hark!&rdquo; and she started as
if at Eberhard&rsquo;s foot-step; then smiled, recollecting that
Ebbo had his father&rsquo;s tread.&nbsp; But her husband had been
too much in awe of her to enter with that hasty agitated step and
exclamation, &ldquo;Mother, mother, what insolence is
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Ebbo!&nbsp; I prayed mine uncle to let me speak
to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, then,&rdquo; said Ebbo, dashing his cap on
the ground; &ldquo;I had soundly beaten that grinning
&rsquo;prentice for telling Heinz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly the house rings with the rumour, mother,&rdquo;
said Friedel, &ldquo;but we had not believed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believed Wildschloss assured enough for aught,&rdquo;
said Ebbo, &ldquo;but I thought he knew where to begin.&nbsp;
Does he not know who is head of the house of Adlerstein, since he
must tamper with a mechanical craftsman, cap in hand to any sprig
of nobility!&nbsp; I would have soon silenced his
overtures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it in sooth as we heard?&rdquo; asked Friedel,
blushing to the ears, for the boy was shy as a maiden.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother, we know what you would say,&rdquo; he added,
throwing himself on his knees beside her, his arm round her
waist, his cheek on her lap, and his eyes raised to hers.</p>
<p>She bent down to kiss him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou knewst it,
Friedel, and now must thou aid me to remain thy father&rsquo;s
true widow, and to keep Ebbo from being violent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo checked his hasty march to put his hand on her chair and
kiss her brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Motherling, I will restrain myself,
so you will give me your word not to desert us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Ebbo,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;the motherling
is too true and loving for us to bind her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;hear me
patiently.&nbsp; I have been communing with myself, and deeply do
I feel that none other can I love save him who is to you a mere
name, but to me a living presence.&nbsp; Nor would I put any
between you and me.&nbsp; Fear me not, Ebbo.&nbsp; I think the
mothers and sons of this wider, fuller world do not prize one
another as we do.&nbsp; But, my son, this is no matter for rage
or ingratitude.&nbsp; Remember it is no small condescension in a
noble to stoop to thy citizen mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew what painted puppets noble ladies are,&rdquo;
growled Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; continued Christina, &ldquo;thine
uncle is highly gratified, and cannot believe that I can
refuse.&nbsp; He understands not my love for thy father, and sees
many advantages for us all.&nbsp; I doubt me if he believes I
have power to resist his will, and for thee, he would not count
thine opposition valid.&nbsp; And the more angry and vehement
thou art, the more will he deem himself doing thee a service by
overruling thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come home, mother.&nbsp; Let Heinz lead our horses to
the door in the dawn, and when we are back in free Adlerstein it
will be plain who is master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a flitting would scarce prove our wisdom,&rdquo;
said Christina, &ldquo;to run away with thy mother like a lover
in a ballad.&nbsp; Nay, let me first deal gently with thine
uncle, and speak myself with Sir Kasimir, so that I may show him
the vanity of his suit.&nbsp; Then will we back to Adlerstein
without leaving wounds to requite kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo was wrought on to promise not to attack the burgomaster
on the subject, but he was moody and silent, and Master Gottfried
let him alone, considering his gloom as another proof of his need
of fatherly authority, and as a peace-lover forbearing to provoke
his fiery spirit.</p>
<p>But when Sir Kasimir&rsquo;s visit was imminent, and Christina
had refused to make the change in her dress by which a young
widow was considered to lay herself open to another courtship,
Master Gottfried called the twins apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young lords,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I fear me ye are
vexing your gentle mother by needless strife at what must take
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, good uncle,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;I
utterly decline the honour of Sir Kasimir&rsquo;s suit to my
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Gottfried smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sons are not wont to be
the judges in such cases, Sir Eberhard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but my
mother&rsquo;s will is to the nayward, nor shall she be
coerced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is merely because of you and your pride,&rdquo; said
Master Gottfried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not so,&rdquo; rejoined the calmer Friedel;
&ldquo;my mother&rsquo;s love for my father is still
fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young knights,&rdquo; said Master Gottfried, &ldquo;it
would scarce become me to say, nor you to hear, how much matter
of fancy such love must have been towards one whom she knew but
for a few short months, though her pure sweet dreams, through
these long years, have moulded him into a hero.&nbsp; Boys, I
verily believe ye love her truly.&nbsp; Would it be well for her
still to mourn and cherish a dream while yet in her fresh age,
capable of new happiness, fuller than she has ever
enjoyed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is happy with us,&rdquo; rejoined Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ye are good lads and loving sons, though less
duteous in manner than I could wish.&nbsp; But look you, you may
not ever be with her, and when ye are absent in camp or court, or
contracting a wedlock of your own, would you leave her to her
lonesome life in your solitary castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedel&rsquo;s unselfishness might have been startled, but
Ebbo boldly answered, &ldquo;All mine is hers.&nbsp; No joy to me
but shall be a joy to her.&nbsp; We can make her happier than
could any stranger.&nbsp; Is it not so, Friedel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Friedel, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, rash bloods, promising beyond what ye can
keep.&nbsp; Nature will be too strong for you.&nbsp; Love your
mother as ye may, what will she be to you when a bride comes in
your way?&nbsp; Fling not away in wrath, Sir Baron; it was so
with your parents both before you; and what said the law of the
good God at the first marriage?&nbsp; How can you withstand the
nature He has given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belike I may wed,&rdquo; said Ebbo, bluntly; &ldquo;but
if it be not for my mother&rsquo;s happiness, call me man-sworn
knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; good-humouredly answered Gottfried,
&ldquo;but boy-sworn paladin, who talks of he knows not
what.&nbsp; Speak knightly truth, Sir Baron, and own that this
opposition is in verity from distaste to a stepfather&rsquo;s
rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own that I will not brook such rule,&rdquo; said
Ebbo; &ldquo;nor do I know what we have done to deserve that it
should be thrust on us.&nbsp; You have never blamed Friedel, at
least; and verily, uncle, my mother&rsquo;s eye will lead me
where a stranger&rsquo;s hand shall never drive me.&nbsp; Did I
even think she had for this man a quarter of the love she bears
to my dead father, I would strive for endurance; but in good
sooth we found her in tears, praying us to guard her from
him.&nbsp; I may be a boy, but I am man enough to prevent her
from being coerced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this so, Friedel?&rdquo; asked Master Gottfried,
moved more than by all that had gone before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ach, I
thought ye all wiser.&nbsp; And spake she not of Sir
Kasimir&rsquo;s offers?&mdash;Interest with the Romish
king?&mdash;Yea, and a grant of nobility and arms to this house,
so as to fill the blank in your scutcheon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father never asked if she were noble,&rdquo; said
Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor will I barter her for a cantle of a
shield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There spake a manly spirit,&rdquo; said his uncle,
delighted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her worth hath taught thee how little to
prize these gewgaws!&nbsp; Yet, if you look to mingling with your
own proud kind, ye may fall among greater slights than ye can
brook.&nbsp; It may matter less to you, Sir Baron, but Friedel
here, ay, and your sons, will be ineligible to the choicest
orders of knighthood, and the canonries and chapters that are
honourable endowments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedel looked as if he could bear it, and Eberhard said,
&ldquo;The order of the Dove of Adlerstein is enough for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headstrong all, headstrong all,&rdquo; sighed Master
Gottfried.&nbsp; &ldquo;One romantic marriage has turned all your
heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss, unprepared for the
opposition that awaited him, was riding down the street equipped
point device, and with a goodly train of followers, in brilliant
suits.&nbsp; Private wooing did not enter into the honest ideas
of the burghers, and the suitor was ushered into the full family
assembly, where Christina rose and came forward a few steps to
meet him, curtseying as low as he bowed, as he said, &ldquo;Lady,
I have preferred my suit to you through your honour-worthy uncle,
who is good enough to stand my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are over good, sir.&nbsp; I feel the honour, but a
second wedlock may not be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; murmured Ebbo to his brother, as the knight
and lady seated themselves in full view, &ldquo;now will the
smooth-tongued fellow talk her out of her senses.&nbsp; Alack!
that gipsy prophecy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wildschloss did not talk like a young wooer; such days were
over for both; but he spoke as a grave and honourable man, deeply
penetrated with true esteem and affection.&nbsp; He said that at
their first meeting he had been struck with her sweetness and
discretion, and would soon after have endeavoured to release her
from her durance, but that he was bound by the contract already
made with the Trautbachs, who were dangerous neighbours to
Wildschloss.&nbsp; He had delayed his distasteful marriage as
long as possible, and it had caused him nothing but trouble and
strife; his children would not live, and Thekla, the only
survivor, was, as his sole heiress, a mark for the cupidity of
her uncle, the Count of Trautbach, and his almost savage son
Lassla; while the right to the Wildschloss barony would become so
doubtful between her and Ebbo, as heir of the male line, that
strife and bloodshed would be well-nigh inevitable.&nbsp; These
causes made it almost imperative that he should re-marry, and his
own strong preference and regard for little Thekla directed his
wishes towards the Freiherrinn von Adlerstein.&nbsp; He backed
his suit with courtly compliments, as well as with
representations of his child&rsquo;s need of a mother&rsquo;s
training, and the twins&rsquo; equal want of fatherly guidance,
dilating on the benefits he could confer on them.</p>
<p>Christina felt his kindness, and had full trust in his
intentions.&nbsp; &ldquo;No&rdquo; was a difficult syllable to
her, but she had that within her which could not accept him; and
she firmly told him that she was too much bound to both her
Eberhards.&nbsp; But there was no daunting him, nor preventing
her uncle and aunt from encouraging him.&nbsp; He professed that
he would wait, and give her time to consider; and though she
reiterated that consideration would not change her mind, Master
Gottfried came forward to thank him, and express his confidence
of bringing her to reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I, sir,&rdquo; said Ebbo, with flashing eyes, and
low but resentful voice, &ldquo;beg to decline the honour in the
name of the elder house of Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held himself upright as a dart, but was infinitely annoyed
by the little mocking bow and smile that he received in return,
as Sir Kasimir, with his long mantle, swept out of the apartment,
attended by Master Gottfried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burgomaster Sorel,&rdquo; said the boy, standing in the
middle of the floor as his uncle returned, &ldquo;let me hear
whether I am a person of any consideration in this family or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew baron,&rdquo; quietly replied Master Gottfried,
&ldquo;it is not the use of us Germans to be dictated to by
youths not yet arrived at years of discretion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, mother,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;we leave this
place to-morrow morn.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at her nod of assent the
house-father looked deeply grieved, the house-mother began to
clamour about ingratitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; answered
Ebbo, fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;We quit the house as poor as we
came, in homespun and with the old mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, Ebbo!&rdquo; said his mother, rising;
&ldquo;peace, I entreat, house-mother! pardon, uncle, I pray
thee.&nbsp; O, why will not all who love me let me follow that
which I believe to be best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; said her uncle, &ldquo;I cannot see thee
domineered over by a youth whose whole conduct shows his need of
restraint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor am I,&rdquo; said Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I
who am utterly averse to this offer.&nbsp; My sons and I are one
in that; and, uncle, if I pray of you to consent to let us return
to our castle, it is that I would not see the visit that has made
us so happy stained with strife and dissension!&nbsp; Sure, sure,
you cannot be angered with my son for his love for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the self-seeking of his love,&rdquo; said Master
Gottfried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is to gratify his own pride that he
first would prevent thee from being enriched and ennobled, and
now would bear thee away to the scant&mdash;Nay, Freiherr, I will
not seem to insult you, but resentment would make you cruel to
your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not cruel!&rdquo; said Friedel, hastily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My mother is willing.&nbsp; And verily, good uncle,
methinks that we all were best at home.&nbsp; We have benefited
much and greatly by our stay; we have learnt to love and
reverence you; but we are wild mountaineers at the best; and,
while our hearts are fretted by the fear of losing our sweet
mother, we can scarce be as patient or submissive as if we had
been bred up by a stern father.&nbsp; We have ever judged and
acted for ourselves, and it is hard to us not to do so still,
when our minds are chafed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friedel,&rdquo; said Ebbo, sternly, &ldquo;I will have
no pardon asked for maintaining my mother&rsquo;s cause.&nbsp; Do
not thou learn to be smooth-tongued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O thou wrong-headed boy!&rdquo; half groaned Master
Gottfried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did not all this fall out ten years
sooner, when thou wouldst have been amenable?&nbsp; Yet, after
all, I do not know that any noble training has produced a more
high-minded loving youth,&rdquo; he added, half relenting as he
looked at the gallant, earnest face, full of defiance indeed, but
with a certain wistful appealing glance at &ldquo;the
motherling,&rdquo; softening the liquid lustrous dark eye.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Get thee gone, boy, I would not quarrel with you; and it
may be, as Friedel says, that we are best out of one
another&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; You are used to lord it, and I can
scarce make excuses for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Ebbo, scarce appeased, &ldquo;I take
home my mother, and you, sir, cease to favour Kasimir&rsquo;s
suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir Baron.&nbsp; I cease not to think that nothing
would be so much for your good.&nbsp; It is because I believe
that a return to your own old castle will best convince you all
that I will not vex your mother by further opposing your
departure.&nbsp; When you perceive your error may it only not be
too late!&nbsp; Such a protector is not to be found every
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother shall never need any protector save
myself,&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;but, sir, she loves you, and
owes all to you.&nbsp; Therefore I will not be at strife with
you, and there is my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said it as if he had been the Emperor reconciling himself
to all the Hanse towns in one.&nbsp; Master Gottfried could
scarce refrain from shrugging his shoulders, and Hausfrau Johanna
was exceedingly angry with the petulant pride and insolence of
the young noble; but, in effect, all were too much relieved to
avoid an absolute quarrel with the fiery lad to take exception at
minor matters.&nbsp; The old burgher was forbearing; Christina,
who knew how much her son must have swallowed to bring him to
this concession for love of her, thought him a hero worthy of all
sacrifices; and peace-making Friedel, by his aunt&rsquo;s side,
soon softened even her, by some of the persuasive arguments that
old dames love from gracious, graceful, great-nephews.</p>
<p>And when, by and by, Master Gottfried went out to call on Sir
Kasimir, and explain how he had thought it best to yield to the
hot-tempered lad, and let the family learn how to be thankful for
the goods they had rejected, he found affairs in a state that
made him doubly anxious that the young barons should be safe on
their mountain without knowing of them.&nbsp; The Trautbach
family had heard of Wildschloss&rsquo;s designs, and they had set
abroad such injurious reports respecting the Lady of Adlerstein,
that Sir Kasimir was in the act of inditing a cartel to be sent
by Count Kaulwitz, to demand an explanation&mdash;not merely as
the lady&rsquo;s suitor, but as the only Adlerstein of full
age.&nbsp; Now, if Ebbo had heard of the rumour, he would
certainly have given the lie direct, and taken the whole defence
on himself; and it may be feared that, just as his cause might
have been, Master Gottfried&rsquo;s faith did not stretch to
believing that it would make his sixteen-year-old arm equal to
the brutal might of Lassla of Trautbach.&nbsp; So he heartily
thanked the Baron of Wildschloss, agreed with him that the young
knights were not as yet equal to the maintenance of the cause,
and went home again to watch carefully that no report reached
either of his nephews.&nbsp; Nor did he breathe freely till he
had seen the little party ride safe off in the early morning, in
much more lordly guise than when they had entered the city.</p>
<p>As to Wildschloss and his nephew of Trautbach, in spite of
their relationship they had a sharp combat on the borders of
their own estates, in which both were severely wounded; but Sir
Kasimir, with the misericorde in his grasp, forced Lassla to
retract whatever he had said in dispraise of the Lady of
Adlerstein.&nbsp; Wily old Gottfried took care that the tidings
should be sent in a form that might at once move Christina with
pity and gratitude towards her champion, and convince her sons
that the adversary was too much hurt for them to attempt a fresh
challenge.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EAGLE AND THE SNAKE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reconciliation made Ebbo
retract his hasty resolution of relinquishing all the benefits
resulting from his connection with the Sorel family, and his
mother&rsquo;s fortune made it possible to carry out many changes
that rendered the castle and its inmates far more prosperous in
appearance than had ever been the case before.&nbsp; Christina
had once again the appliances of a <i>wirthschaft</i>, such as
she felt to be the suitable and becoming appurtenance of a
right-minded Frau, gentle or simple, and she felt so much the
happier and more respectable.</p>
<p>A chaplain had also been secured.&nbsp; The youths had
insisted on his being capable of assisting their studies, and, a
good man had been found who was fearfully learned, having studied
at all possible universities, but then failing as a teacher,
because he was so dreamy and absent as to be incapable of keeping
the unruly students in order.&nbsp; Jobst Sch&ouml;n was his
proper name, but he was translated into Jodocus Pulcher.&nbsp;
The chapel was duly adorned, the hall and other chambers were
fitted up with some degree of comfort; the castle court was
cleansed, the cattle sheds removed to the rear, and the serfs
were presented with seed, and offered payment in coin if they
would give their labour in fencing and clearing the cornfield and
vineyard which the barons were bent on forming on the sunny slope
of the ravine.&nbsp; Poverty was over, thanks to the marriage
portion, and yet Ebbo looked less happy than in the days when
there was but a bare subsistence; and he seemed to miss the full
tide of city life more than did his brother, who, though he had
enjoyed Ulm more heartily at the time, seemed to have returned to
all his mountain delights with greater zest than ever.&nbsp; At
his favourite tarn, he revelled in the vast stillness with the
greater awe for having heard the hum of men, and his minstrel
dreams had derived fresh vigour from contact with the active
world.&nbsp; But, as usual, he was his brother&rsquo;s chief stay
in the vexations of a reformer.&nbsp; The serfs had much rather
their lord had turned out a freebooter than an improver.&nbsp;
Why should they sow new seeds, when the old had sufficed their
fathers?&nbsp; Work, beyond the regulated days when they
scratched up the soil of his old enclosure, was abhorrent to
them.&nbsp; As to his offered coin, they needed nothing it would
buy, and had rather bask in the sun or sleep in the smoke.&nbsp;
A vineyard had never been heard of on Adlerstein mountain: it was
clean contrary to his forefathers&rsquo; habits; and all came of
the bad drop of restless burgher blood, that could not let honest
folk rest.</p>
<p>Ebbo stormed, not merely with words, but blows, became ashamed
of his violence, tried to atone for it by gifts and kind words,
and in return was sulkily told that he would bring more good to
the village by rolling the fiery wheel straight down hill at the
wake, than by all his new-fangled ways.&nbsp; Had not Koppel and
a few younger men been more open to influence, his agricultural
schemes could hardly have begun; but Friedel&rsquo;s persuasions
were not absolutely without success, and every rood that was dug
was achieved by his patience and perseverance.</p>
<p>Next came home the Graf von Schlangenwald.&nbsp; He had of
late inhabited his castle in Styria, but in a fierce quarrel with
some of his neighbours he had lost his eldest son, and the
pacification enforced by the King of the Romans had so galled and
infuriated him that he had deserted that part of the country and
returned to Swabia more fierce and bitter than ever.&nbsp;
Thenceforth began a petty border warfare such as had existed when
Christina first knew Adlerstein, but had of late died out.&nbsp;
The shepherd lad came home weeping with wrath.&nbsp; Three
mounted Schlangenwaldern had driven off his four best sheep, and
beaten himself with their halberds, though he was safe on
Adlerstein ground.&nbsp; Then a light thrown by a Schlangenwald
reiter consumed all Jobst&rsquo;s pile of wood.&nbsp; The swine
did not come home, and were found with spears sticking in them;
the great broad-horned bull that Ebbo had brought from the
pastures of Ulm vanished from the Alp below the Gemsbock&rsquo;s
Pass, and was known to be salted for winter use at
Schlangenwald.</p>
<p>Still Christina tried to persuade her sons that this might be
only the retainers&rsquo; violence, and induced Ebbo to write a
letter, complaining of the outrages, but not blaming the Count,
only begging that his followers might be better restrained.&nbsp;
The letter was conveyed by a lay brother&mdash;no other messenger
being safe.&nbsp; Ebbo had protested from the first that it would
be of no use, but he waited anxiously for the answer.</p>
<p>Thus it stood, when conveyed to him by a tenant of the
Ruprecht cloister:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wot you, Eberhard, Freiherr von Adlerstein,
that your house have injured me by thought, word, and deed.&nbsp;
Your great-grandfather usurped my lands at the ford.&nbsp; Your
grandfather stole my cattle and burnt my mills.&nbsp; Then, in
the war, he slew my brother Johann and lamed for life my cousin
Matthias.&nbsp; Your father slew eight of my retainers and
spoiled my crops.&nbsp; You yourself claim my land at the ford,
and secure the spoil which is justly mine.&nbsp; Therefore do I
declare war and feud against you.&nbsp; Therefore to you and all
yours, to your helpers and helpers&rsquo; helpers, am I a
foe.&nbsp; And thereby shall I have maintained my honour against
you and yours.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Wolfgang</span>,
Graf von Schlangenwald.<br />
<span class="smcap">Hierom</span>, Graf von
Schlangenwald&mdash;his cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a long list of names, all connected with Schlangenwald,
followed; and a large seal, bearing the snake of Schlangenwald,
was appended thereto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old miscreant!&rdquo; burst out Ebbo; &ldquo;it is
a feud brief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feud brief!&rdquo; exclaimed Friedel; &ldquo;they are
no longer according to the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law?&mdash;what cares he for law or mercy either?&nbsp;
Is this the way men act by the League?&nbsp; Did we not swear to
send no more feud letters, nor have recourse to
fist-right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must appeal to the Markgraf of Wurtemburg,&rdquo;
said Friedel.</p>
<p>It was the only measure in their power, though Ebbo winced at
it; but his oaths were recent, and his conscience would not allow
him to transgress them by doing himself justice.&nbsp; Besides,
neither party could take the castle of the other, and the only
reprisals in his power would have been on the defenceless
peasants of Schlangenwald.&nbsp; He must therefore lay the whole
matter before the Markgraf, who was the head of the Swabian
League, and bound to redress his wrongs.&nbsp; He made his
arrangements without faltering, selecting the escort who were to
accompany him, and insisting on leaving Friedel to guard his
mother and the castle.&nbsp; He would not for the world have
admitted the suggestion that the counsel and introduction of
Adlerstein Wildschloss would have been exceedingly useful to
him.</p>
<p>Poor Christina!&nbsp; It was a great deal too like that former
departure, and her heart was heavy within her!&nbsp; Friedel was
equally unhappy at letting his brother go without him, but it was
quite necessary that he and the few armed men who remained should
show themselves at all points open to the enemy in the course of
the day, lest the Freiherr&rsquo;s absence should be
remarked.&nbsp; He did his best to cheer his mother, by reminding
her that Ebbo was not likely to be taken at unawares as their
father had been; and he shared the prayers and chapel services,
in which she poured out her anxiety.</p>
<p>The blue banner came safe up the Pass again, but Wurtemburg
had been formally civil to the young Freiherr; but he had laughed
at the fend letter as a mere old-fashioned habit of
Schangenwald&rsquo;s that it was better not to notice, and he
evidently regarded the stealing of a bull or the misusing of a
serf as far too petty a matter for his attention.&nbsp; It was as
if a judge had been called by a crying child to settle a nursery
quarrel.&nbsp; He told Ebbo that, being a free Baron of the
empire, he must keep his bounds respected; he was free to take
and hang any spoiler he could catch, but his bulls were his own
affair: the League was not for such gear.</p>
<p>And a knight who had ridden out of Stuttgard with Ebbo had
told him that it was no wonder that this had been his reception,
for not only was Schlangenwald an old intimate of the Markgraf,
but Swabia was claimed as a fief of Wurtemburg, so that
Ebbo&rsquo;s direct homage to the Emperor, without the
interposition of the Markgraf, had made him no object of
favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be done?&rdquo; asked Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire some Schlangenwald hamlet, and teach him to
respect yours,&rdquo; said the knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor serfs are guiltless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! as if they would not rob any of yours.&nbsp;
Give and take, that&rsquo;s the way the empire wags, Sir
Baron.&nbsp; Send him a feud letter in return, with a goodly file
of names at its foot, and teach him to respect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have sworn to abstain from fist-right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much you gain by so abstaining.&nbsp; If the League
will not take the trouble to right you, right
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall appeal to the Emperor, and tell him how his
League is administered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young sir, if the Emperor were to guard every cow in
his domains he would have enough to do.&nbsp; You will never
prosper with him without some one to back your cause better than
that free tongue of yours.&nbsp; Hast no sister that thou couldst
give in marriage to a stout baron that could aid you with strong
arm and prudent head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only one twin brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! the twins of Adlerstein!&nbsp; I remember me.&nbsp;
Was not the other Adlerstein seeking an alliance with your lady
mother?&nbsp; Sure no better aid could be found.&nbsp; He is hand
and glove with young King Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may never be,&rdquo; said Ebbo, haughtily.&nbsp;
And, sure that he should receive the same advice, he decided
against turning aside to consult his uncle at Ulm, and returned
home in a mood that rejoiced Heinz and Hatto with hopes of the
old days, while it filled his mother with dreary dismay and
apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schlangenwald should suffer next time he
transgressed,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;It should not again
be said that he himself was a coward who appealed to the law
because his hand could not keep his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;next time&rdquo; was when the first winter cold was
setting in.&nbsp; A party of reitern came to harry an outlying
field, where Ulrich had raised a scanty crop of rye.&nbsp;
Tidings reached the castle in such good time that the two
brothers, with Heinz, the two Ulm grooms, Koppel, and a troop of
serfs, fell on the marauders before they had effected much
damage, and while some remained to trample out the fire, the rest
pursued the enemy even to the village of Schlangenwald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burn it, Herr Freiherr,&rdquo; cried Heinz, hot with
victory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let them learn how to make havoc of our
corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a host of half-naked beings rushed out shrieking about
sick children, bed-ridden grandmothers, and crippled fathers, and
falling on their knees, with their hands stretched out to the
young barons.&nbsp; Ebbo turned away his head with hot tears in
his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friedel, what can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not barbarous murder,&rdquo; said Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they brand us for cowards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cowardice were in striking here,&rdquo; and Friedel
sprang to withhold Koppel, who had lighted a bundle of dried fern
ready to thrust into the thatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peasants!&rdquo; said Ebbo, with the same impulse,
&ldquo;I spare you.&nbsp; You did not this wrong.&nbsp; But bear
word to your lord, that if he will meet me with lance and sword,
he will learn the valour of Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serfs flung themselves before him in transports of
gratitude, but he turned hastily away and strode up the mountain,
his cheek glowing as he remembered, too late, that his defiance
would be scoffed at, as a boy&rsquo;s vaunt.&nbsp; By and by he
arrived at the hamlet, where he found a prisoner, a scowling,
abject fellow, already well beaten, and now held by two
serfs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The halter is ready, Herr Freiherr,&rdquo; said old
Ulrich, &ldquo;and yon rowan stump is still as stout as when your
Herr grandsire hung three lanzknechts on it in one day.&nbsp; We
only waited your bidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick then, and let me hear no more,&rdquo; said Ebbo,
about to descend the pass, as if hastening from the execution of
a wolf taken in a gin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he seen the priest?&rdquo; asked Friedel.</p>
<p>The peasants looked as if this were one of Sir Friedel&rsquo;s
unaccountable fancies.&nbsp; Ebbo paused, frowned, and muttered,
but seeing a move as if to drag the wretch towards the stunted
bush overhanging an abyss, he shouted, &ldquo;Hold, Ulrich!&nbsp;
Little Hans, do thou run down to the castle, and bring Father
Jodocus to do his office!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serfs were much disgusted.&nbsp; &ldquo;It never was so
seen before, Herr Freiherr,&rdquo; remonstrated Heinz;
&ldquo;fang and hang was ever the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shrift had my lord&rsquo;s father, or mine?&rdquo;
added Koppel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you!&rdquo; said Ebbo, turning sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If Schlangenwald be a godless ruffian, pitiless alike to
soul and body, is that a cause that I should stain myself
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were true vengeance,&rdquo; growled Koppel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; grumbled Ulrich, &ldquo;will my lady
hear, and there will be feeble pleadings for the vermin&rsquo;s
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like mutterings ensued, the purport of which was caught by
Friedel, and made him say to Ebbo, who would again have escaped
the disagreeableness of the scene, &ldquo;We had better tarry at
hand.&nbsp; Unless we hold the folk in some check there will be
no right execution.&nbsp; They will torture him to death ere the
priest comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo yielded, and began to pace the scanty area of the flat
rock where the need-fire was wont to blaze.&nbsp; After a time he
exclaimed: &ldquo;Friedel, how couldst ask me?&nbsp; Knowst not
that it sickens me to see a mountain cat killed, save in full
chase.&nbsp; And thou&mdash;why, thou art white as the snow
crags!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better conquer the folly than that he there should be
put to needless pain,&rdquo; said Friedel, but with labouring
breath that showed how terrible was the prospect to his
imaginative soul not inured to death-scenes like those of his
fellows.</p>
<p>Just then a mocking laugh broke forth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;
cried Ebbo, looking keenly down, &ldquo;what do ye there?&nbsp;
Fang and hang may be fair; fang and torment is base!&nbsp; What
was it, Lieschen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only, Herr Freiherr, the caitiff craved drink, and the
fleischerinn gave him a cup from the stream behind the
slaughter-house, where we killed the swine.&nbsp; Fit for the
like of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens, when I forbade torture!&rdquo; cried Ebbo,
leaping from the rock in time to see the disgusting draught held
to the lips of the captive, whose hands were twisted back and
bound with cruel tightness; for the German boor, once roused from
his lazy good-nature, was doubly savage from stolidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretches!&rdquo; cried Ebbo, striking right and left
with the back of his sword, among the serfs, and then cutting the
thong that was eating into the prisoner&rsquo;s flesh, while
Friedel caught up a wooden bowl, filled it with pure water, and
offered it to the captive, who drank deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;hast ought to say for
thyself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low curse against things in general was the only answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought thee here?&rdquo; continued Ebbo, in hopes
of extracting some excuse for pardon; but the prisoner only hung
his head as one stupefied, brutally indifferent and hardened
against the mere trouble of answering.&nbsp; Not another word
could be extracted, and Ebbo&rsquo;s position was very
uncomfortable, keeping guard over his condemned felon, with the
sulky peasants herding round, in fear of being balked of their
prey; and the reluctance growing on him every moment to taking
life in cold blood.&nbsp; Right of life and death was a heavy
burden to a youth under seventeen, unless he had been thoughtless
and reckless, and from this Ebbo had been prevented by his
peculiar life.&nbsp; The lion cub had never tasted blood.</p>
<p>The situation was prolonged beyond expectation.</p>
<p>Many a time had the brothers paced their platform of rock, the
criminal had fallen into a dose, and women and boys were
murmuring that they must call home their kine and goats, and it
was a shame to debar them of the sight of the hanging, long
before Hans came back between crying and stammering, to say that
Father Jodocus had fallen into so deep a study over his book,
that he only muttered &ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; then went into
another musing fit, whence no one could rouse him to do more than
say &ldquo;Coming!&nbsp; Let him wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go and bring him, if the thing is to be
done,&rdquo; said Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let it last all night!&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, if the man were to die, it should be at once, not by
inches.&nbsp; Hark thee, rogue!&rdquo; stirring him with his
foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;is the hanging
ready yet?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been long enough about it for us to
have twisted the necks of every Adlerstein of you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look thee, caitiff!&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;thou
meritest the rope as well as any wolf on the mountain, but we
have kept thee so long in suspense, that if thou canst say a word
for thy life, or pledge thyself to meddle no more with my lands,
I&rsquo;ll consider of thy doom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had plenty of time to consider it,&rdquo;
growled the fellow.</p>
<p>A murmur, followed by a wrathful shout, rose among the
villagers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Letting off the villain!&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; Out upon him!&nbsp; He dares not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare!&rdquo; thundered Ebbo, with flashing eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rascals as ye are, think ye to hinder me from
daring?&nbsp; Your will to be mine?&nbsp; There, fellow; away
with thee!&nbsp; Up to the Gemsbock&rsquo;s Pass!&nbsp; And whoso
would follow him, let him do so at his peril!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner was prompt to gather himself up and rush like a
hunted animal to the path, at the entrance of which stood both
twins, with drawn swords, to defend the escape.&nbsp; Of course
no one ventured to follow; and surly discontented murmurs were
the sole result as the peasants dispersed.&nbsp; Ebbo, sheathing
his sword, and putting his arm into his brother&rsquo;s, said:
&ldquo;What, Friedel, turned stony-hearted?&nbsp; Hadst never a
word for the poor caitiff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew thou wouldst never do the deed,&rdquo; said
Friedel, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was such wretched prey,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yet shall I be despised for this!&nbsp; Would that thou
hadst let me string him up shriftless, as any other man had done,
and there would have been an end of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And even his mother&rsquo;s satisfaction did not greatly
comfort Ebbo, for he was of the age to feel more ashamed of a
solecism than a crime.&nbsp; Christina perceived that this was
one of his most critical periods of life, baited as he was by the
enemy of his race, and feeling all the disadvantages which heart
and conscience gave him in dealing with a man who had neither, at
a time when public opinion was always with the most
masterful.&nbsp; The necessity of arming his retainers and having
fighting men as a guard were additional temptations to hereditary
habits of violence; and that so proud and fiery a nature as his
should never become involved in them was almost beyond
hope.&nbsp; Even present danger seemed more around than ever
before.&nbsp; The estate was almost in a state of siege, and
Christina never saw her sons quit the castle without thinking of
their father&rsquo;s fate, and passing into the chapel to entreat
for their return unscathed in body or soul.&nbsp; The snow, which
she had so often hailed as a friend, was never more welcome than
this winter; not merely as shutting the enemy out, and her sons
in, but as cutting off all danger of a visit from her suitor, who
would now come armed with his late sufferings in her behalf; and,
moreover, with all the urgent need of a wise and respected head
and protector for her sons.&nbsp; Yet the more evident the
expediency became, the greater grew her distaste.</p>
<p>Still the lonely life weighed heavily on Ebbo.&nbsp;
Light-hearted Friedel was ever busy and happy, were he chasing
the grim winter game&mdash;the bear and wolf&mdash;with his
brother, fencing in the hall, learning Greek with the chaplain,
reading or singing to his mother, or carving graceful angel forms
to adorn the chapel.&nbsp; Or he could at all times soar into a
minstrel dream of pure chivalrous semi-allegorical romance,
sometimes told over the glowing embers to his mother and
brother.&nbsp; All that came to Friedel was joy, from battling
with the bear on a frozen rock, to persuading rude little Hans to
come to the Frau Freiherrinn to learn his Paternoster.&nbsp; But
the elder twin might hunt, might fence, might smile or kindle at
his brother&rsquo;s lay, but ever with a restless gloom on him, a
doubt of the future which made him impatient of the present, and
led to a sharpness and hastiness of manner that broke forth in
anger at slight offences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matron&rsquo;s coif succeeding the widow&rsquo;s
veil,&rdquo; Friedel heard him muttering even in sleep, and more
than once listened to it as Ebbo leant over the
battlements&mdash;as he looked over the white world to the gray
mist above the city of Ulm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou, who mockest my forebodings and fancies, to dwell
on that gipsy augury!&rdquo; argued Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;As thou
saidst at the time, Wildschloss&rsquo;s looks gave shrewd cause
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer is in mine own heart,&rdquo; answered
Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since our stay at Ulm, I have ever felt as
though the sweet motherling were less my own!&nbsp; And the same
with my house and lands.&nbsp; Rule as I will, a mocking laugh
comes back to me, saying: &lsquo;Thou art but a boy, Sir Baron,
thou dost but play at lords and knights.&rsquo;&nbsp; If I had
hung yon rogue of a reiter, I wonder if I had felt my grasp more
real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Friedel, glancing from the sparkling
white slopes to the pure blue above, &ldquo;our whole life is but
a play at lords and knights, with the blessed saints as witnesses
of our sport in the tilt-yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were it merely that,&rdquo; said Ebbo, impatiently,
&ldquo;I were not so galled.&nbsp; Something hangs over us,
Friedel!&nbsp; I long that these snows would melt, that I might
at least know what it is!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BRIDGING THE FORD</span></h2>
<p>The snow melted, the torrent became a flood, then contracted
itself, but was still a broad stream, when one spring afternoon
Ebbo showed his brother some wains making for the ford, adding,
&ldquo;It cannot be rightly passable.&nbsp; They will come to
loss.&nbsp; I shall get the men together to aid them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blew a blast on his horn, and added, &ldquo;The knaves will
be alert enough if they hope to meddle with honest men&rsquo;s
luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; and Friedel pointed to the thicket to the
westward of the meadow around the stream, where the beech trees
were budding, but not yet forming a full mass of verdure,
&ldquo;is not the Snake in the wood?&nbsp; Methinks I spy the
glitter of his scales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens, the villains are lying in wait for the
travellers at our landing-place,&rdquo; cried Ebbo, and again
raising the bugle to his lips, he sent forth three notes well
known as a call to arms.&nbsp; Their echoes came back from the
rocks, followed instantly by lusty jodels, and the brothers
rushed into the hall to take down their light head-pieces and
corslets, answering in haste their mother&rsquo;s startled
questions, by telling of the endangered travellers, and the
Schlangenwald ambush.&nbsp; She looked white and trembled, but
said no word to hinder them; only as she clasped Friedel&rsquo;s
corslet, she entreated them to take fuller armour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must speed the short way down the rock,&rdquo; said
Ebbo, &ldquo;and cannot be cumbered with heavy harness.&nbsp;
Sweet motherling, fear not; but let a meal be spread for our
rescued captives.&nbsp; Ho, Heinz, &rsquo;tis against the
Schlangenwald rascals.&nbsp; Art too stiff to go down the rock
path?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; nor down the abyss, could I strike a good stroke
against Schlangenwald at the bottom of it,&rdquo; quoth
Heinz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor see vermin set free by the Freiherr,&rdquo; growled
Koppel; but the words were lost in Ebbo&rsquo;s loud commands to
the men, as Friedel and Hatto handed down the weapons to
them.</p>
<p>The convoy had by this time halted, evidently to try the
ford.&nbsp; A horseman crossed, and found it practicable, for a
waggon proceeded to make the attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our time,&rdquo; said Ebbo, who was standing on
the narrow ledge between the castle and the precipitous path
leading to the meadow.&nbsp; &ldquo;One waggon may get over, but
the second or third will stick in the ruts that it leaves.&nbsp;
Now we will drop from our crag, and if the Snake falls on them,
why, then for a pounce of the Eagle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two young knights, so goodly in their bright steel, knelt
for their mother&rsquo;s blessing, and then sprang like chamois
down the ivy-twined steep, followed by their men, and were lost
to sight among the bushes and rocks.&nbsp; Yet even while her
frame quivered with fear, her heart swelled at the thought what a
gulf there was between these days and those when she had hidden
her face in despair, while Ermentrude watched the Debateable
Ford.</p>
<p>She watched now in suspense, indeed, but with exultation
instead of shame, as two waggons safely crossed; but the third
stuck fast, and presently turned over in the stream, impelled
sideways by the efforts of the struggling horses.&nbsp; Then,
amid endeavours to disentangle the animals and succour the
driver, the travellers were attacked by a party of armed men, who
dashed out of the beechwood, and fell on the main body of the
waggons, which were waiting on the bit of bare shingly soil that
lay between the new and old channels.&nbsp; A wild
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e was all that Christina could see&mdash;weapons
raised, horses starting, men rushing from the river, while the
clang and the shout rose even to the castle.</p>
<p>Hark!&nbsp; Out rings the clear call, &ldquo;The Eagle to the
rescue!&rdquo;&nbsp; There they speed over the meadow, the two
slender forms with glancing helms!&nbsp; O overrun not the
followers, rush not into needless danger!&nbsp; There is Koppel
almost up with them with his big axe&mdash;Heinz&rsquo;s broad
shoulders near.&nbsp; Heaven strike with them!&nbsp; Visit not
their forefathers&rsquo; sin on those pure spirits.&nbsp; Some
are flying.&nbsp; Some one has fallen!&nbsp; O heavens! on which
side?&nbsp; Ah! it is into the Schlangenwald woods that the
fugitives direct their flight.&nbsp; Three&mdash;four&mdash;the
whole troop pursued!&nbsp; Go not too far!&nbsp; Run not into
needless risk!&nbsp; Your work is done, and gallantly.&nbsp; Well
done, young knights of Adlerstein!&nbsp; Which of you is it that
stands pointing out safe standing-ground for the men that are
raising the waggon?&nbsp; Which of you is it who stands in
converse with a burgher form?&nbsp; Thanks and blessings! the
lads are safe, and full knightly hath been their first
emprise.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, a gay step mounted the ascent, and
Friedel&rsquo;s bright face laughed from his helmet:
&ldquo;There, mother, will you crown your knights?&nbsp; Could
you see Ebbo bear down the chief squire? for the old Snake was
not there himself.&nbsp; And whom do you think we rescued,
besides a whole band of Venetian traders to whom he had joined
himself?&nbsp; Why, my uncle&rsquo;s friend, the architect, of
whom he used to speak&mdash;Master Moritz
Schleiermacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moritz Schleiermacher!&nbsp; I knew him as a
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been laying out a Lustgarten for the Romish king
at Innspruck, and he is a stout man of his hands, and attempted
defence; but he had such a shrewd blow before we came up, that he
lay like one dead; and when he was lifted up, he gazed at us like
one moon-struck, and said, &lsquo;Are my eyes dazed, or are these
the twins of Adlerstein, that are as like as face to
mirror?&nbsp; Lads, lads, your uncle looked not to hear of you
acting in this sort.&rsquo;&nbsp; But soon we and his people let
him know how it was, and that eagles do not have the manner of
snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Master Moritz!&nbsp; Is he much hurt?&nbsp; Is
Ebbo bringing him up hither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother, he is but giddied and stunned, and now must
you send down store of sausage, sourkraut, meat, wine, and beer;
for the wains cannot all cross till daylight, and we must keep
ward all night lest the Schlangenwalden should fall on them
again.&nbsp; Plenty of good cheer, mother, to make a right merry
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take heed, Friedel mine; a merry watch is scarce a safe
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, sweet motherling, and therefore must Ebbo and
I share it.&nbsp; You must mete out your liquor wisely, you see,
enough for the credit of Adlerstein, and enough to keep out the
marsh fog, yet not enough to make us snore too soundly.&nbsp; I
am going to take my lute; it would be using it ill not to let it
enjoy such a chance as a midnight watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So away went the light-hearted boy, and by and by Christina
saw the red watch-fire as she gazed from her turret window.&nbsp;
She would have been pleased to see how, marshalled by a merchant
who had crossed the desert from Egypt to Palestine, the waggons
were ranged in a circle, and the watches told off, while the food
and drink were carefully portioned out.</p>
<p>Freiherr Ebbo, on his own ground, as champion and host, was
far more at ease than in the city, and became very friendly with
the merchants and architect as they sat round the bright fire,
conversing, or at times challenging the mountain echoes by songs
to the sound of Friedel&rsquo;s lute.&nbsp; When the stars grew
bright, most lay down to sleep in the waggons, while others
watched, pacing up and down till Karl&rsquo;s waggon should be
over the mountain, and the vigil was relieved.</p>
<p>No disturbance took place, and at sunrise a hasty meal was
partaken of, and the work of crossing the river was set in
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; said Moritz, the architect, &ldquo;that
this ford were not spanned by a bridge, to the avoiding of danger
and spoil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could build such a bridge?&rdquo; asked Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourself, Herr Freiherr, in union with us burghers of
Ulm.&nbsp; It were well worth your while to give land and stone,
and ours to give labour and skill, provided we fixed a toll on
the passage, which would be willingly paid to save peril and
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers caught at the idea, and the merchants agreed that
such a bridge would be an inestimable boon to all traffickers
between Constance, Ulm, and Augsburg, and would attract many
travellers who were scared away by the evil fame of the
Debateable Ford.&nbsp; Master Moritz looked at the stone of the
mountain, pronounced it excellent material, and already sketched
the span of the arches with a view to winter torrents.&nbsp; As
to the site, the best was on the firm ground above the ford; but
here only one side was Adlerstein, while on the other Ebbo
claimed both banks, and it was probable that an equally sound
foundation could be obtained, only with more cost and delay.</p>
<p>After this survey, the travellers took leave of the barons,
promising to write when their fellow-citizens should have been
sounded as to the bridge; and Ebbo remained in high spirits, with
such brilliant purposes that he had quite forgotten his gloomy
forebodings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace instead of war at home,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;with the revenue it will bring, I will build a mill,
and set our lads to work, so that they may become less dull and
doltish than their parents.&nbsp; Then will we follow the Emperor
with a train that none need despise!&nbsp; No one will talk now
of Adlerstein not being able to take care of himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letters came from Ulm, saying that the guilds of mercers and
wine merchants were delighted with the project, and invited the
Baron of Adlerstein to a council at the Rathhaus.&nbsp; Master
Sorel begged the mother to come with her sons to be his guest;
but fearing the neighbourhood of Sir Kasimir, she remained at
home, with Heinz for her seneschal while her sons rode to the
city.&nbsp; There Ebbo found that his late exploit and his future
plan had made him a person of much greater consideration than on
his last visit, and he demeaned himself with far more ease and
affability in consequence.&nbsp; He had affairs on his hands too,
and felt more than one year older.</p>
<p>The two guilds agreed to build the bridge, and share the toll
with the Baron in return for the ground and materials; but they
preferred the plan that placed one pier on the Schlangenwald
bank, and proposed to write to the Count an offer to include him
in the scheme, awarding him a share of the profits in proportion
to his contribution.&nbsp; However vexed at the turn affairs had
taken, Ebbo could offer no valid objection, and was obliged to
affix his signature to the letter in company with the
guildmasters.</p>
<p>It was despatched by the city pursuivants&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The only men who safe might ride;<br />
Their errands on the border side;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and a meeting was appointed in the Rathhaus for the day of
their expected return.&nbsp; The higher burghers sat on their
carved chairs in the grand old hall, the lesser magnates on
benches, and Ebbo, in an elbowed seat far too spacious for his
slender proportions, met a glance from Friedel that told him his
merry brother was thinking of the frog and the ox.&nbsp; The
pursuivants entered&mdash;hardy, shrewd-looking men, with the
city arms decking them wherever there was room for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour-worthy sirs,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;no letter
did the Graf von Schlangenwald return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent he no message?&rdquo; demanded Moritz
Schleiermacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, worthy sir, but scarce befitting this reverend
assembly.&rdquo;&nbsp; On being pressed, however, it was
repeated: &ldquo;The Lord Count was pleased to swear at what he
termed the insolence of the city in sending him heralds,
&lsquo;as if,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the dogs,&rsquo; your
worships, &lsquo;were his equals.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then having cursed
your worships, he reviled the crooked writing of Herr Clerk
Diedrichson, and called his chaplain to read it to him.&nbsp;
Herr Priest could scarce read three lines for his foul language
about the ford.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;would
he consent to raising a bridge&mdash;a mean trick,&rsquo; so said
he, &lsquo;for defrauding him of his rights to what the flood
sent him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Ebbo, &ldquo;took he no note of our
explanation, that if he give not the upper bank, we will build
lower, where both sides are my own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He passed it not entirely over,&rdquo; replied the
messenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What said he&mdash;the very words?&rdquo; demanded
Ebbo, with the paling cheek and low voice that made his passion
often seem like patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said&mdash;(the Herr Freiherr will pardon me for
repeating the words)&mdash;he said, &lsquo;Tell the misproud
mongrel of Adlerstein that he had best sit firm in his own saddle
ere meddling with his betters, and if he touch one pebble of the
Braunwasser, he will rue it.&nbsp; And before your city-folk take
up with him or his, they had best learn whether he have any right
at all in the case.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His right is plain,&rdquo; said Master Gottfried;
&ldquo;full proofs were given in, and his investiture by the
Kaisar forms a title in itself.&nbsp; It is mere bravado, and an
endeavour to make mischief between the Baron and the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so did I explain, Herr Guildmaster,&rdquo; said
the pursuivant; &ldquo;but, pardon me, the Count laughed me to
scorn, and quoth he, &lsquo;asked the Kaisar for proof of his
father&rsquo;s death!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mere mischief-making, as before,&rdquo; said Master
Gottfried, while his nephews started with amaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
father&rsquo;s death was proved by an eye-witness, whom you still
have in your train, have you not, Herr Freiherr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; replied Ebbo, &ldquo;he is at Adlerstein
now, Heinrich Bauermann, called the Schneiderlein, a lanzknecht,
who alone escaped the slaughter, and from whom we have often
heard how my father died, choked in his own blood, from a deep
breast-wound, immediately after he had sent home his last
greetings to my lady mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the corpse restored?&rdquo; asked the able
Rathsherr Ulrich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Almost all our
retainers had perished, and when a friar was sent to the hostel
to bring home the remains, it appeared that the treacherous foe
had borne them off&mdash;nay, my grandfather&rsquo;s head was
sent to the Diet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole assembly agreed that the Count could only mean to
make the absence of direct evidence about a murder committed
eighteen years ago tell in sowing distrust between the
allies.&nbsp; The suggestion was not worth a thought, and it was
plain that no site would be available except the Debateable
Strand.&nbsp; To this, however, Ebbo&rsquo;s title was
assailable, both on account of his minority, as well as his
father&rsquo;s unproved death, and of the disputed claim to the
ground.&nbsp; The Rathsherr, Master Gottfried, and others,
therefore recommended deferring the work till the Baron should be
of age, when, on again tendering his allegiance, he might obtain
a distinct recognition of his marches.&nbsp; But this policy did
not consort with the quick spirit of Moritz Schleiermacher, nor
with the convenience of the mercers and wine-merchants, who were
constant sufferers by the want of a bridge, and afraid of waiting
four years, in which a lad like the Baron might return to the
nominal instincts of his class, or the Braunwasser might take
back the land it had given; whilst Ebbo himself was urgent, with
all the defiant fire of youth, to begin building at once in spite
of all gainsayers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strife and blood will it cost,&rdquo; said Master
Sorel, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be had worth the having save at cost of strife
and blood?&rdquo; said Ebbo, with a glance of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth speaks of counting the cost.&nbsp; Little knows
it what it saith,&rdquo; sighed Master Gottfried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned the Rathsherr, &ldquo;were it
otherwise, who would have the heart for enterprise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the young knights mounted, and had ridden about half the
way in silence, when Ebbo exclaimed,
&ldquo;Friedel&rdquo;&mdash;and as his brother started,
&ldquo;What art musing on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thou art thinking of,&rdquo; said Friedel, turning
on him an eye that had not only something of the brightness but
of the penetration of a sunbeam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think thereon at all,&rdquo; said Ebbo,
gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a figment of the old serpent to
hinder us from snatching his prey from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;I cannot but
remember that the Genoese merchant of old told us of a German
noble sold by his foes to the Moors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folly!&nbsp; That tale was too recent to concern my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not think it did,&rdquo; said Friedel; &ldquo;but
mayhap that noble&rsquo;s family rest equally certain of his
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pfui!&rdquo; said Ebbo, hotly; &ldquo;hast not heard
fifty times how he died even in speaking, and how Heinz crossed
his hands on his breast?&nbsp; What wouldst have more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly even that,&rdquo; said Friedel, slightly
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; hastily returned his brother, &ldquo;I
meant only by way of proof.&nbsp; Would an honest old fellow like
Heinz be a deceiver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not wittingly.&nbsp; Yet I would fain ride to that
hostel and make inquiries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traitor host met his deserts, and was broken on the
wheel for murdering a pedlar a year ago,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would I knew where my father was buried, for then would
I bring his corpse honourably back; but as to his being a living
man, I will not have it spoken of to trouble my
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To trouble her?&rdquo; exclaimed Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To trouble her,&rdquo; repeated Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Long
since hath passed the pang of his loss, and there is reason in
what old Sorel says, that he must have been a rugged, untaught
savage, with little in common with the gentle one, and that
tender memory hath decked him out as he never could have
been.&nbsp; Nay, Friedel, it is but sense.&nbsp; What could a man
have been under the granddame&rsquo;s breeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It becomes not thee to say so!&rdquo; returned
Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, he could learn to love our
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One sign of grace, but doubtless she loved him the
better for their having been so little together.&nbsp; Her heart
is at peace, believing him in his grave; but let her imagine him
in Schlangenwald&rsquo;s dungeon, or some Moorish galley, if thou
likest it better, and how will her mild spirit be
rent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be so,&rdquo; said Friedel,
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may be best to keep this secret
from her till we have fuller certainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed then,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;unless the
Wildschloss fellow should again molest us, when his answer is
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this just towards my mother?&rdquo; said
Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just!&nbsp; What mean&rsquo;st thou?&nbsp; Is it not
our office and our dearest right to shield our mother from
care?&nbsp; And is not her chief wish to be rid of the
Wildschloss suit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Ebbo was moody all the way home, but when there
he devoted himself in his most eager and winning way to his
mother, telling her of Master Gottfried&rsquo;s woodcuts, and
Hausfrau Johanna&rsquo;s rheumatism, and of all the news of the
country, in especial that the Kaisar was at Lintz, very ill with
a gangrene in his leg, said to have been caused by his habit of
always kicking doors open, and that his doctors thought of
amputation, a horrible idea in the fifteenth century.&nbsp; The
young baron was evidently bent on proving that no one could make
his mother so happy as he could; and he was not far wrong
there.</p>
<p>Friedel, however, could not rest till he had followed Heinz to
the stable, and speaking over the back of the old white mare, the
only other survivor of the massacre, had asked him once more for
the particulars, a tale he was never loth to tell; but when
Friedel further demanded whether he was certain of having seen
the death of his younger lord, he replied, as if hurt:
&ldquo;What, think you I would have quitted him while life was
yet in him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly, good Heinz; yet I would fain know by
what tokens thou knewest his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Sir Friedel; when you have seen a stricken
field or two, you will not ask how I know death from
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a swoon so utterly unlike death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say not but that an inexperienced youth might be
mistaken,&rdquo; said Heinz; &ldquo;but for one who had learned
the bloody trade, it were impossible.&nbsp; Why ask,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Friedel, low and
mysteriously&mdash;&ldquo;my brother would not have my mother
know it, but&mdash;Count Schlangenwald demanded whether we could
prove my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prove!&nbsp; He could not choose but die with three
such wounds, as the old ruffian knows.&nbsp; I shall bless the
day, Sir Friedmund, when I see you or your brother give back
those strokes!&nbsp; A heavy reckoning be his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all deem that line only meant to cross our
designs,&rdquo; said Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet, Heinz, I would I
knew how to find out what passed when thou wast gone.&nbsp; Is
there no servant at the inn&mdash;no retainer of Schlangenwald
that aught could be learnt from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By St. Gertrude,&rdquo; roughly answered the
Schneiderlein, &ldquo;if you cannot be satisfied with the oath of
a man like me, who would have given his life to save your father,
I know not what will please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedel, with his wonted good-nature, set himself to pacify
the warrior with assurances of his trust; yet while Ebbo plunged
more eagerly into plans for the bridge-building, Friedel drew
more and more into his old world of musings; and many a summer
afternoon was spent by him at the Ptarmigan&rsquo;s Mere, in deep
communings with himself, as one revolving a purpose.</p>
<p>Christina could not but observe, with a strange sense of
foreboding, that, while one son was more than ever in the lonely
mountain heights, the other was far more at the base.&nbsp;
Master Moritz Schleiermacher was a constant guest at the castle,
and Ebbo was much taken up with his companionship.&nbsp; He was a
strong, shrewd man, still young, but with much experience, and he
knew how to adapt himself to intercourse with the proud nobility,
preserving an independent bearing, while avoiding all that
haughtiness could take umbrage at; and thus he was acquiring a
greater influence over Ebbo than was perceived by any save the
watchful mother, who began to fear lest her son was acquiring an
infusion of worldly wisdom and eagerness for gain that would
indeed be a severance between him and his brother.</p>
<p>If she had known the real difference that unconsciously kept
her sons apart, her heart would have ached yet more.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FRIEDMUND IN THE CLOUDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stone was quarried high on the
mountain, and a direct road was made for bringing it down to the
water-side.&nbsp; The castle profited by the road in
accessibility, but its impregnability was so far lessened.&nbsp;
However, as Ebbo said, it was to be a friendly harbour, instead
of a robber crag, and in case of need the communication could
easily be destroyed.&nbsp; The blocks of stone were brought down,
and wooden sheds were erected for the workmen in the meadow.</p>
<p>In August, however, came tidings that, after two amputations
of his diseased limb, the Kaisar Friedrich III. had died&mdash;it
was said from over free use of melons in the fever consequent on
the operation.&nbsp; His death was not likely to make much change
in the government, which had of late been left to his son.&nbsp;
At this time the King of the Romans (for the title of Kaisar was
conferred only by coronation by the Pope, and this Maximilian
never received) was at Innspruck collecting troops for the
deliverance of Styria and Carinthia from a horde of invading
Turks.&nbsp; The Markgraf of Wurtemburg sent an intimation to all
the Swabian League that the new sovereign would be best pleased
if their homage were paid to him in his camp at the head of their
armed retainers.</p>
<p>Here was the way of enterprise and honour open at last, and
the young barons of Adlerstein eagerly prepared for it, equipping
their vassals and sending to Ulm to take three or four
men-at-arms into their pay, so as to make up twenty lances as the
contingent of Adlerstein.&nbsp; It was decided that Christina
should spend the time of their absence at Ulm, whither her sons
would escort her on their way to the camp.&nbsp; The last busy
day was over, and in the summer evening Christina was sitting on
the castle steps listening to Ebbo&rsquo;s eager talk of his
plans of interesting his hero, the King of the Romans, in his
bridge, and obtaining full recognition of his claim to the
Debateable Strand, where the busy workmen could be seen far
below.</p>
<p>Presently Ebbo, as usual when left to himself, grew restless
for want of Friedel, and exclaiming, &ldquo;The musing fit is on
him!&mdash;he will stay all night at the tarn if I fetch him
not,&rdquo; he set off in quest of him, passing through the
hamlet to look for him in the chapel on his way.</p>
<p>Not finding Friedel there, he was, however, some way up
towards the tarn, when he met his brother wearing the beamy yet
awestruck look that he often brought from the mountain height,
yet with a steadfast expression of resolute purpose on his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dreamer!&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;I knew where to
seek thee!&nbsp; Ever in the clouds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been to the tarn,&rdquo; said Friedel,
throwing his arm round his brother&rsquo;s neck in their boyish
fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been very dear to me, and I longed
to see its gray depths once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once!&nbsp; Yea manifold times shalt thou see
them,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Schleiermacher tells me that
these are no Janissaries, but a mere miscreant horde, even by
whom glory can scarce be gained, and no peril at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;but it is to me
as if I were taking my leave of all these purple hollows and
heaven-lighted peaks cleaving the sky.&nbsp; All the more, Ebbo,
since I have made up my mind to a resolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, none of the old monkish fancies,&rdquo; cried
Ebbo, &ldquo;against them thou art sworn, so long as I am true
knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not the monkish fancy, but I am convinced
that it is my duty to strive to ascertain my father&rsquo;s
fate.&nbsp; Hold, I say not that it is thine.&nbsp; Thou hast thy
charge here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for a dead man,&rdquo; growled Ebbo; &ldquo;a
proper quest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; returned Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the
camp it will surely be possible to learn, through either
Schlangenwald or his men, how it went with my father.&nbsp; Men
say that his surviving son, the Teutonic knight, is of very
different mould.&nbsp; He might bring something to light.&nbsp;
Were it proved to be as the Schneiderlein avers, then would our
conscience be at rest; but, if he were in Schlangenwald&rsquo;s
dungeon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folly!&nbsp; Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet men have pined eighteen years in dark
vaults,&rdquo; said Friedel; &ldquo;and, when I think that so may
he have wasted for the whole of our lives that have been so free
and joyous on his own mountain, it irks me to bound on the
heather or gaze at the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the serpent hath dared,&rdquo; cried Ebbo,
&ldquo;though it is mere folly to think of it, we would summon
the League and have his castle about his ears!&nbsp; Not that I
believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarce do I,&rdquo; said Friedel; &ldquo;but there
haunts me evermore the description of the kindly German chained
between the decks of the Corsair&rsquo;s galley.&nbsp; Once and
again have I dreamt thereof.&nbsp; And, Ebbo, recollect the
prediction that so fretted thee.&nbsp; Might not yon dark-cheeked
woman have had some knowledge of the East and its
captives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo started, but resumed his former tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
thou wouldst begin thine errantry like Sir Hildebert and Sir
Hildebrand in the &lsquo;Rose garden&rsquo;?&nbsp; Have a
care.&nbsp; Such quests end in mortal conflict between the
unknown father and son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should know him,&rdquo; said Friedel,
enthusiastically, &ldquo;or, at least, he would know my
mother&rsquo;s son in me; and, could I no otherwise ransom him, I
would ply the oar in his stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine exchange for my mother and me,&rdquo; gloomily
laughed Ebbo, &ldquo;to lose thee, my sublimated self, for a
rude, savage lord, who would straightway undo all our work, and
rate and misuse our sweet mother for being more civilized than
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame, Ebbo!&rdquo; cried Friedel, &ldquo;or art thou
but in jest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far in jest that thou wilt never go, puissant Sir
Hildebert,&rdquo; returned Ebbo, drawing him closer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou wilt learn&mdash;as I also trust to do&mdash;in what
nameless hole the serpent hid his remains.&nbsp; Then shall they
be duly coffined and blazoned.&nbsp; All the monks in the
cloisters for twenty miles round shall sing requiems, and thou
and I will walk bareheaded, with candles in our hands, by the
bier, till we rest him in the Blessed Friedmund&rsquo;s chapel;
and there Lucas Handlein shall carve his tomb, and thou shalt sit
for the likeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So may it end,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;but either I
will know him dead, or endeavour somewhat in his behalf.&nbsp;
And that the need is real, as well as the purpose blessed, I have
become the more certain, for, Ebbo, as I rose to descend the
hill, I saw on the cloud our patron&rsquo;s very form&mdash;I saw
myself kneel before him and receive his blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo burst out laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now know I that it is
indeed as saith Schleiermacher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that
these phantoms of the Blessed Friedmund are but shadows cast by
the sun on the vapours of the ravine.&nbsp; See, Friedel, I had
gone to seek thee at the chapel, and meeting Father Norbert, I
bent my knee, that I might take his farewell blessing.&nbsp; I
had the substance, thou the shadow, thou dreamer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedel was as much mortified for the moment as his gentle
nature could be.&nbsp; Then he resumed his sweet smile, saying,
&ldquo;Be it so!&nbsp; I have oft read that men are too prone to
take visions and special providences to themselves, and now I
have proved the truth of the saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;thou seest thy purpose is
as baseless as thy vision?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ebbo.&nbsp; It grieves me to differ from thee, but
my resolve is older than the fancy, and may not be shaken because
I was vain enough to believe that the Blessed Friedmund could
stoop to bless me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; shouted Ebbo, glad to see an object on which
to vent his secret annoyance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who goes there,
skulking round the rocks?&nbsp; Here, rogue, what art after
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm,&rdquo; sullenly replied a half-clad boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence art thou?&nbsp; From Schlangenwald, to spy what
more we can be robbed of?&nbsp; The lash&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; interposed Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perchance
the poor lad had no evil purposes.&nbsp; Didst lose thy
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, my mother sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; cried Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
comes of sparing the nest of thankless adders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;mayhap it is because
they are not thankless that the poor fellow is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the boy, coming nearer, &ldquo;I will
tell <i>you</i>&mdash;<i>you</i> I will tell&mdash;not him who
threatens.&nbsp; Mother said you spared our huts, and the lady
gave us bread when we came to the castle gate in winter, and she
would not see the reiters lay waste your folk&rsquo;s doings down
there without warning you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good lad!&nbsp; What saidst thou?&rdquo; cried Ebbo,
but the boy seemed dumb before him, and Friedel repeated the
question ere he answered: &ldquo;All the lanzknechts and reiters
are at the castle, and the Herr Graf has taken all my
father&rsquo;s young sheep for them, a plague upon him.&nbsp; And
our folk are warned to be at the muster rock to-morrow morn, each
with a bundle of straw and a pine brand; and Black Berend heard
the body squire say the Herr Graf had sworn not to go to the wars
till every stick at the ford be burnt, every stone drowned, every
workman hung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo, in a transport of indignation and gratitude, thrust his
hand into his pouch, and threw the boy a handful of groschen,
while Friedel gave warm thanks, in the utmost haste, ere both
brothers sprang with headlong speed down the wild path, to take
advantage of the timely intelligence.</p>
<p>The little council of war was speedily assembled, consisting
of the barons, their mother, Master Moritz Schleiermacher, Heinz,
and Hatto.&nbsp; To bring up to the castle the workmen, their
families, and the more valuable implements, was at once decided;
and Christina asked whether there would be anything left worth
defending, and whether the Schlangenwalden might not expend their
fury on the scaffold, which could be newly supplied from the
forest, the huts, which could be quickly restored, and the
stones, which could hardly be damaged.&nbsp; The enemy must
proceed to the camp in a day or two, and the building would be
less assailable by their return; and, besides, it was scarcely
lawful to enter on a private war when the imperial banner was in
the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craving your pardon, gracious lady,&rdquo; said the
architect, &ldquo;that blame rests with him who provokes the
war.&nbsp; See, lord baron, there is time to send to Ulm, where
the two guilds, our allies, will at once equip their trained
bands and despatch them.&nbsp; We meanwhile will hold the knaves
in check, and, by the time our burghers come up, the snake brood
will have had such a lesson as they will not soon forget.&nbsp;
Said I well, Herr Freiherr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right bravely,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
consorts not with our honour or rights, with my pledges to Ulm,
or the fame of my house, to shut ourselves up and see the rogues
work their will scatheless.&nbsp; My own score of men, besides
the stouter masons, carpenters, and serfs, will be fully enough
to make the old serpent of the wood rue the day, even without the
aid of the burghers.&nbsp; Not a word against it, dearest
mother.&nbsp; None is so wise as thou in matters of peace, but
honour is here concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My question is,&rdquo; persevered the mother,
&ldquo;whether honour be not better served by obeying the summons
of the king against the infidel, with the men thou hast called
together at his behest?&nbsp; Let the count do his worst; he
gives thee legal ground of complaint to lay before the king and
the League, and all may there be more firmly
established.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That were admirable counsel, lady,&rdquo; said
Schleiermacher, &ldquo;well suited to the honour-worthy
guildmaster Sorel, and to our justice-loving city; but, in
matters of baronial rights and aggressions, king and League are
wont to help those that help themselves, and those that are over
nice as to law and justice come by the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the worst in the long run,&rdquo; said Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thine unearthly code will not serve us here, Friedel
mine,&rdquo; returned his brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did I not defend
the work I have begun, I should be branded as a weak fool.&nbsp;
Nor will I see the foes of my house insult me without striking a
fair stroke.&nbsp; Hap what hap, the Debateable Ford shall be
debated!&nbsp; Call in the serfs, Hatto, and arm them.&nbsp;
Mother, order a good supper for them.&nbsp; Master Moritz, let us
summon thy masons and carpenters, and see who is a good man with
his hands among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina saw that remonstrance was vain.&nbsp; The days of
peril and violence were coming back again; and all she could take
comfort in was, that, if not wholly right, her son was far from
wholly wrong, and that with a free heart she could pray for a
blessing on him and on his arms.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FIGHT AT THE FORD</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the early September sunrise the
thicket beneath the pass was sheltering the twenty well-appointed
reiters of Adlerstein, each standing, holding his horse by the
bridle, ready to mount at the instant.&nbsp; In their rear were
the serfs and artisans, some with axes, scythes, or ploughshares,
a few with cross-bows, and Jobst and his sons with the long
blackened poles used for stirring their charcoal fires.&nbsp; In
advance were Master Moritz and the two barons, the former in a
stout plain steel helmet, cuirass, and gauntlets, a sword, and
those new-fashioned weapons, pistols; the latter in full knightly
armour, exactly alike, from the gilt-spurred heel to the
eagle-crested helm, and often moving restlessly forward to watch
for the enemy, though taking care not to be betrayed by the
glitter of their mail.&nbsp; So long did they wait that there was
even a doubt whether it might not have been a false alarm; the
boy was vituperated, and it was proposed to despatch a spy to see
whether anything were doing at Schlangenwald.</p>
<p>At length a rustling and rushing were heard; then a clank of
armour.&nbsp; Ebbo vaulted into the saddle, and gave the word to
mount; Schleiermacher, who always fought on foot, stepped up to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep back your men, Herr Freiherr.&nbsp; Let
his design be manifest.&nbsp; We must not be said to have fallen
on him on his way to the muster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be but as he served my father!&rdquo; muttered
Ebbo, forced, however, to restrain himself, though with boiling
blood, as the tramp of horses shook the ground, and bright armour
became visible on the further side of the stream.</p>
<p>For the first time, the brothers beheld the foe of their
line.&nbsp; He was seated on a clumsy black horse, and sheathed
in full armour, and was apparently a large heavy man, whose
powerful proportions were becoming unwieldy as he advanced in
life.&nbsp; The dragon on his crest and shield would have made
him known to the twins, even without the deadly curse that passed
the Schneiderlein&rsquo;s lips at the sight.&nbsp; As the armed
troop, out-numbering the Adlersteiners by about a dozen, and
followed by a rabble with straw and pine brands, came forth on
the meadow, the count halted and appeared to be giving
orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruffian!&nbsp; He is calling them on!&nbsp;
Now&mdash;&rdquo; began Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, there is no sign yet that he is not peacefully on
his journey to the camp,&rdquo; responded Moritz; and, chafing
with impatient fury, the knight waited while Schlangenwald rode
towards the old channel of the Braunwasser, and there, drawing
his rein, and sitting like a statue in his stirrups, he could
hear him shout: &ldquo;The lazy dogs are not astir yet.&nbsp; We
will give them a r&eacute;veille.&nbsp; Forward with your
brands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; and Ebbo&rsquo;s cream-coloured horse leapt
forth, as the whole band flashed into the sunshine from the
greenwood covert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who troubles the workmen on my land?&rdquo; shouted
Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who you may be I care not,&rdquo; replied the count,
&ldquo;but when I find strangers unlicensed on my lands, I burn
down their huts.&nbsp; On, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back, fellows!&rdquo; called Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoso
touches a stick on Adlerstein ground shall suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;this is the
burgher-bred, burgher-fed varlet, that calls himself of
Adlerstein!&nbsp; Boy, thou had best be warned.&nbsp; Wert thou
true-blooded, it were worth my while to maintain my rights
against thee.&nbsp; Craven as thou art, not even with spirit to
accept my feud, I would fain not have the trouble of sweeping
thee from my path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Graf, as true Freiherr and belted knight, I defy
thee!&nbsp; I proclaim my right to this ground, and whoso damages
those I place there must do battle with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt have it then,&rdquo; said the count, taking
his heavy lance from his squire, closing his visor, and wheeling
back his horse, so as to give space for his career.</p>
<p>Ebbo did the like, while Friedel on one side, and Hierom von
Schlangenwald on the other, kept their men in array, awaiting the
issue of the strife between their leaders&mdash;the fire of
seventeen against the force of fifty-six.</p>
<p>They closed in full shock, with shivered lances and rearing,
pawing horses, but without damage to either.&nbsp; Each drew his
sword, and they were pressing together, when Heinz, seeing a
Schlangenwalder aiming with his cross-bow, rode at him furiously,
and the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e became general; shots were fired, not
only from cross-bows, but from arquebuses, and in the throng
Friedel lost sight of the main combat between his brother and the
count.</p>
<p>Suddenly however there was a crash, as of falling men and
horses, with a shout of victory strangely mingled with a cry of
agony, and both sides became aware that their leaders had
fallen.&nbsp; Each party rushed to its fallen head.&nbsp; Friedel
beheld Ebbo under his struggling horse, and an enemy dashing at
his throat, and, flying to the rescue, he rode down the
assailant, striking him with his sword; and, with the instinct of
driving the foe as far as possible from his brother, he struck
with a sort of frenzy, shouting fiercely to his men, and leaping
over the dry bed of the river, rushing onward with an
intoxication of ardour that would have seemed foreign to his
gentle nature, but for the impetuous desire to protect his
brother.&nbsp; Their leaders down, the enemy had no one to rally
them, and, in spite of their superiority in number, gave way in
confusion before the furious onset of Adlerstein.&nbsp; So soon,
however, as Friedel perceived that he had forced the enemy far
back from the scene of conflict, his anxiety for his brother
returned, and, leaving the retainers to continue the pursuit, he
turned his horse.&nbsp; There, on the green meadow, lay on the
one hand Ebbo&rsquo;s cream-coloured charger, with his master
under him, on the other the large figure of the count; and
several other prostrate forms likewise struggled on the sand and
pebbles of the strand, or on the turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the architect, who had turned with
Friedel, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas a gallant feat, Sir Friedel, and I
trust there is no great harm done.&nbsp; Were it the mere dint of
the count&rsquo;s sword, your brother will be little the
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ebbo!&nbsp; Ebbo mine, look up!&rdquo; cried Friedel,
leaping from his horse, and unclasping his brother&rsquo;s
helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friedel!&rdquo; groaned a half-suffocated voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O take away the horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One or two of the artisans were at hand, and with their help
the dying steed was disengaged from the rider, who could not
restrain his moans, though Friedel held him in his arms, and
endeavoured to move him as gently as possible.&nbsp; It was then
seen that the deep gash from the count&rsquo;s sword in the chest
was not the most serious injury, but that an arquebus ball had
pierced his thigh, before burying itself in the body of his
horse; and that the limb had been further crushed and wrenched by
the animal&rsquo;s struggles.&nbsp; He was nearly unconscious,
and gasped with anguish, but, after Moritz had bathed his face
and moistened his lips, as he lay in his brother&rsquo;s arms, he
looked up with clearer eyes, and said: &ldquo;Have I slain
him?&nbsp; It was the shot, not he, that sent me down.&nbsp;
Lives he?&nbsp; See&mdash;thou, Friedel&mdash;thou.&nbsp; Make
him yield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Transferring Ebbo to the arms of Schleiermacher, Friedel
obeyed, and stepped towards the fallen foe.&nbsp; The wrongs of
Adlerstein were indeed avenged, for the blood was welling fast
from a deep thrust above the collar-bone, and the failing, feeble
hand was wandering uncertainly among the clasps of the
gorget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me aid,&rdquo; said Friedel, kneeling down, and in
his pity for the dying man omitting the summons to yield, he
threw back the helmet, and beheld a grizzled head and stern hard
features, so embrowned by weather and inflamed by intemperance,
that even approaching death failed to blanch them.&nbsp; A scowl
of malignant hate was in the eyes, and there was a thrill of
angry wonder as they fell on the lad&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou again,&mdash;thou whelp!&nbsp; I thought at least I
had made an end of thee,&rdquo; he muttered, unheard by Friedel,
who, intent on the thought that had recurred to him with greater
vividness than ever, was again filling Ebbo&rsquo;s helmet with
water.&nbsp; He refreshed the dying man&rsquo;s face with it,
held it to his lips, and said: &ldquo;Herr Graf, variance and
strife are ended now.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake, say where I
may find my father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&nbsp; Wouldst find him?&rdquo; replied
Schlangenwald, fixing his look on the eager countenance of the
youth, while his hand, with a dying man&rsquo;s nervous
agitation, was fumbling at his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would bless you for ever, could I but free
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know then,&rdquo; said the count, speaking very slowly,
and still holding the young knight&rsquo;s gaze with a sort of
intent fascination, by the stony glare of his light gray eyes,
&ldquo;know that thy villain father is a Turkish slave, unless he
be&mdash;as I hope&mdash;where his mongrel son may find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith came a flash, a report; Friedel leaped back,
staggered, fell; Ebbo started to a sitting posture, with
horrified eyes, and a loud shriek, calling on his brother; Moritz
sprang to his feet, shouting, &ldquo;Shame! treason!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call you to witness that I had not yielded,&rdquo;
said the count.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an end of the
brood!&rdquo; and with a grim smile, he straightened his limbs,
and closed his eyes as a dead man, ere the indignant artisans
fell on him in savage vengeance.</p>
<p>All this had passed like a flash of lightning, and Friedel had
almost at the instant of his fall flung himself towards his
brother, and raising himself on one hand, with the other clasped
Ebbo&rsquo;s, saying, &ldquo;Fear not; it is nothing,&rdquo; and
he was bending to take Ebbo&rsquo;s head again on his knee, when
a gush of dark blood, from his left side, caused Moritz to
exclaim, &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Sir Friedel, the traitor did his
work!&nbsp; That is no slight hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&nbsp; How?&nbsp; The ruffian!&rdquo; cried Ebbo,
supporting himself on his elbow, so as to see his brother, who
rather dreamily put his hand to his side, and, looking at the
fresh blood that immediately dyed it, said, &ldquo;I do not feel
it.&nbsp; This is more numb dulness than pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad sign that,&rdquo; said Moritz, apart to one of
the workmen, with whom he held counsel how to carry back to the
castle the two young knights, who remained on the bank, Ebbo
partly extended on the ground, partly supported on the knee and
arm of Friedel, who sat with his head drooping over him, their
looks fixed on one another, as if conscious of nothing else on
earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Freiherr,&rdquo; said Moritz, presently,
&ldquo;have you breath to wind your bugle to call the men back
from the pursuit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo essayed, but was too faint, and Friedel, rousing himself
from the stupor, took the horn from him, and made the mountain
echoes ring again, but at the expense of a great effusion of
blood.</p>
<p>By this time, however, Heinz was riding back, and a moment his
exultation changed to rage and despair, when he saw the condition
of his young lords.&nbsp; Master Schleiermacher proposed to lay
them on some of the planks prepared for the building, and carry
them up the new road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; said Friedel, &ldquo;that I could ride
if I were lifted on horseback, and thus would our mother be less
shocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well thought,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on and
cheer her.&nbsp; Show her thou canst keep the saddle, however it
may be with me,&rdquo; he added, with a groan of anguish.</p>
<p>Friedel made the sign of the cross over him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
holy cross keep us and her, Ebbo,&rdquo; he said, as he bent to
assist in laying his brother on the boards, where a mantle had
been spread; then kissed his brow, saying, &ldquo;We shall be
together again soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo was lifted on the shoulders of his bearers, and Friedel
strove to rise, with the aid of Heinz, but sank back, unable to
use his limbs; and Schleiermacher was the more concerned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It goes so with the backbone,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir Friedmund, you had best be carried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, for my mother&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; And I would fain
be on my good steed&rsquo;s back once again!&rdquo; he
entreated.&nbsp; And when with much difficulty he had been lifted
to the back of his cream-colour, who stood as gently and
patiently as if he understood the exigency of the moment, he sat
upright, and waved his hand as he passed the litter, while Ebbo,
on his side, signed to him to speed on and prepare their
mother.&nbsp; Long, however, before the castle was reached, dizzy
confusion and leaden helplessness, when no longer stimulated by
his brother&rsquo;s presence, so grew on him that it was with
much ado that Heinz could keep him in his saddle; but, when he
saw his mother in the castle gateway, he again collected his
forces, bade Heinz withdraw his supporting arm, and,
straightening himself, waved a greeting to her, as he called
cheerily; &ldquo;Victory, dear mother.&nbsp; Ebbo has overthrown
the count, and you must not be grieved if it be at some cost of
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, my son!&rdquo; was all Christina could say, for
his effort at gaiety formed a ghastly contrast with the gray,
livid hue that overspread his fair young face, his bloody armour,
and damp disordered hair, and even his stiff unearthly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, motherling,&rdquo; he added, as she came so near
that he could put his arm round her neck, &ldquo;sorrow not, for
Ebbo will need thee much.&nbsp; And, mother,&rdquo; as his face
lighted up, &ldquo;there is joy coming to you.&nbsp; Only I would
that I could have brought him.&nbsp; Mother, he died not under
the Schlangenwald swords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&nbsp; Not Ebbo?&rdquo; cried the bewildered
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own Eberhard, our father,&rdquo; said Friedel,
raising her face to him with his hand, and adding, as he met a
startled look, &ldquo;The cruel count owned it with his last
breath.&nbsp; He is a Turkish slave, and surely heaven will give
him back to comfort you, even though we may not work his
freedom!&nbsp; O mother, I had so longed for it, but God be
thanked that at least certainty was bought by my
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last words were uttered almost
unconsciously, and he had nearly fallen, as the excitement faded;
but, as they were lifting him down, he bent once more and kissed
the glossy neck of his horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! poor fellow, thou
too wilt be lonely.&nbsp; May Ebbo yet ride thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother had no time for grief.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; She might
have full time for that by and by!&nbsp; The one wish of the
twins was to be together, and presently both were laid on the
great bed in the upper chamber, Ebbo in a swoon from the pain of
the transport, and Friedel lying so as to meet the first look of
recovery.&nbsp; And, after Ebbo&rsquo;s eyes had re-opened, they
watched one another in silence for a short space, till Ebbo said:
&ldquo;Is that the hue of death on thy face, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I well believe so,&rdquo; said Friedel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever together,&rdquo; said Ebbo, holding his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;But alas!&nbsp; My mother!&nbsp; Would I had
never sent thee to the traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; So comes her comfort,&rdquo; said
Friedel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heard you not?&nbsp; He owned that my
father was among the Turks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; cried Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have withheld
thee!&nbsp; O Friedel, had I listened to thee, thou hadst not
been in this fatal broil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, ever together,&rdquo; repeated Friedel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Through Ulm merchants will my mother be able to ransom
him.&nbsp; I know she will, so oft have I dreamt of his
return.&nbsp; Then, mother, you will give him our duteous
greetings;&rdquo; and he smiled again.</p>
<p>Like one in a dream Christina returned his smile, because she
saw he wished it, just as the moment before she had been trying
to staunch his wound.</p>
<p>It was plain that the injuries, except Ebbo&rsquo;s sword-cut,
were far beyond her skill, and she could only endeavour to check
the bleeding till better aid could be obtained from Ulm.&nbsp;
Thither Moritz Schleiermacher had already sent, and he assured
her that he was far from despairing of the elder baron, but she
derived little hope from his words, for gunshot wounds were then
so ill understood as generally to prove fatal.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was an undefined impression that the two lives
must end in the same hour, even as they had begun.&nbsp; Indeed,
Ebbo was suffering so terribly, and was so much spent with pain
and loss of blood, that he seemed sinking much faster than
Friedel, whose wound bled less freely, and who only seemed
benumbed and torpid, except when he roused himself to speak, or
was distressed by the writhings and moans which, however, for his
sake, Ebbo restrained as much as he could.</p>
<p>To be together seemed an all-sufficient consolation, and, when
the chaplain came sorrowfully to give them the last rites of the
Church, Ebbo implored him to pray that he might not be left
behind long in purgatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friedel,&rdquo; he said, clasping his brother&rsquo;s
hand, &ldquo;is even like the holy Sebastian or Maurice; but
I&mdash;I was never such as he.&nbsp; O father, will it be my
penance to be left alone when he is in paradise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Friedel, partially roused by
the sound of his name, and the involuntary pressure of his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, Ebbo; one repentance, one cross, one
hope,&rdquo; and he relapsed into a doze, while Ebbo murmured
over a broken, brief confession&mdash;exhausting by its vehemence
of self-accusation for his proud spirit, his wilful neglect of
his lost father, his hot contempt of prudent counsel.</p>
<p>Then, when the priest came round to Friedel&rsquo;s side, and
the boy was wakened to make his shrift, the words were contrite
and humble, but calm and full of trust.&nbsp; They were like two
of their own mountain streams, the waters almost equally
undefiled by external stain&mdash;yet one struggling, agitated,
whirling giddily round; the other still, transparent, and the
light of heaven smiling in its clearness.</p>
<p>The farewell greetings of the Church on earth breathed soft
and sweet in their loftiness, and Friedel, though lying
motionless, and with closed eyes, never failed in the murmured
response, whether fully conscious or not, while his brother only
attended by fits and starts, and was evidently often in too much
pain to know what was passing.</p>
<p>Help was nearer than had been hoped.&nbsp; The summons
despatched the night before had been responded to by the vintners
and mercers; their train bands had set forth, and their captain,
a cautious man, never rode into the way of blows without his
surgeon at hand.&nbsp; And so it came to pass that, before the
sun was low on that long and grievous day, Doctor Johannes
Butteman was led into the upper chamber, where the mother looked
up to him with a kind of hopeless gratitude on her face, which
was nearly as white as those of her sons.&nbsp; The doctor soon
saw that Friedel was past human aid; but, when he declared that
there was fair hope for the other youth, Friedel, whose torpor
had been dispelled by the examination, looked up with his beaming
smile, saying, &ldquo;There, motherling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor then declared that he could not deal with the
Baron&rsquo;s wound unless he were the sole occupant of the bed,
and this sentence brought the first cloud of grief or dread to
Friedel&rsquo;s brow, but only for a moment.&nbsp; He looked at
his brother, who had again fainted at the first touch of his
wounded limb, and said, &ldquo;It is well.&nbsp; Tell the dear
Ebbo that I cannot help it if after all I go to the praying, and
leave him the fighting.&nbsp; Dear, dear Ebbo!&nbsp; One day
together again and for ever!&nbsp; I leave thee for thine own
sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; With much effort he signed the cross again on
his brother&rsquo;s brow, and kissed it long and fervently.&nbsp;
Then, as all stood round, reluctant to effect this severance, or
disturb one on whom death was visibly fast approaching, he
struggled up on his elbow, and held out the other hand, saying,
&ldquo;Take me now, Heinz, ere Ebbo revive to be grieved.&nbsp;
The last sacrifice,&rdquo; he further whispered, whilst almost
giving himself to Heinz and Moritz to be carried to his own bed
in the turret chamber.</p>
<p>There, even as they laid him down, began what seemed to be the
mortal agony, and, though he was scarcely sensible, his mother
felt that her prime call was to him, while his brother was in
other hands.&nbsp; Perhaps it was well for her.&nbsp; Surgical
practice was rough, and wounds made by fire-arms were thought to
have imbibed a poison that made treatment be supposed efficacious
in proportion to the pain inflicted.&nbsp; When Ebbo was recalled
by the torture to see no white reflection of his own face on the
pillow beside him, and to feel in vain for the grasp of the cold
damp hand, a delirious frenzy seized him, and his struggles were
frustrating the doctor&rsquo;s attempts, when a low soft sweet
song stole through the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friedel!&rdquo; he murmured, and held his breath to
listen.&nbsp; All through the declining day did the gentle sound
continue; now of grand chants or hymns caught from the cathedral
choir, now of songs of chivalry or saintly legend so often sung
over the evening fire; the one flowing into the other in the
wandering of failing powers, but never failing in the tender
sweetness that had distinguished Friedel through life.&nbsp; And,
whenever that voice was heard, let them do to him what they
would, Ebbo was still absorbed in intense listening so as not to
lose a note, and lulled almost out of sense of suffering by that
swan-like music.&nbsp; If his attendants made such noise as to
break in on it, or if it ceased for a moment, the anguish
returned, but was charmed away by the weakest, faintest
resumption of the song.&nbsp; Probably Friedel knew not, with any
earthly sense, what he was doing, but to the very last he was
serving his twin brother as none other could have aided him in
his need.</p>
<p>The September sun had set, twilight was coming on, the doctor
had worked his stern will, and Ebbo, quivering in every fibre,
lay spent on his pillow, when his mother glided in, and took her
seat near him, though where she hoped he would not notice her
presence.&nbsp; But he raised his eyelids, and said, &ldquo;He is
not singing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singing indeed, but where we cannot hear him,&rdquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Whiter than the snow, clearer
than the ice-cave, more solemn than the choir.&nbsp; They will
come at last.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was what he said, even as he
entered there.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the low dove-like tone and tender
calm face continued upon Ebbo the spell that the chant had
left.&nbsp; He dozed as though still lulled by its echo.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WOUNDED EAGLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> star and the spark in the
stubble!&nbsp; Often did the presage of her dream occur to
Christina, and assist in sustaining her hopes during the days
that Ebbo&rsquo;s life hung in the balance, and he himself had
hardly consciousness to realize either his brother&rsquo;s death
or his own state, save as much as was shown by the words,
&ldquo;Let him not be taken away, mother; let him wait for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friedmund did wait, in his coffin before the altar in the
castle chapel, covered with a pall of blue velvet, and great
white cross, mournfully sent by Hausfrau Johanna; his sword,
shield, helmet, and spurs laid on it, and wax tapers burning at
the head and feet.&nbsp; And, when Christina could leave the one
son on his couch of suffering, it was to kneel beside the other
son on his narrow bed of rest, and recall, like a breath of
solace, the heavenly loveliness and peace that rested on his
features when she had taken her last long look at them.</p>
<p>Moritz Schleiermacher assisted at Sir Friedmund&rsquo;s first
solemn requiem, and then made a journey to Ulm, whence he
returned to find the Baron&rsquo;s danger so much abated that he
ventured on begging for an interview with the lady, in which he
explained his purpose of repairing at once to the imperial camp,
taking with him a letter from the guilds concerned in the bridge,
and using his personal influence with Maximilian to obtain not
only pardon for the combat, but authoritative sanction to the
erection.&nbsp; Dankwart of Schlangenwald, the Teutonic knight,
and only heir of old Wolfgang, was supposed to be with the
Emperor, and it might be possible to come to terms with him,
since his breeding in the Prussian commanderies had kept him
aloof from the feuds of his father and brother.&nbsp; This
mournful fight had to a certain extent equalized the injuries on
either side, since the man whom Friedel had cut down was Hierom,
one of the few remaining scions of Schlangenwald, and there was
thus no dishonour in trying to close the deadly feud, and coming
to an amicable arrangement about the Debateable Strand, the cause
of so much bloodshed.&nbsp; What was now wanted was Freiherr
Eberhard&rsquo;s signature to the letter to the Emperor, and his
authority for making terms with the new count; and haste was
needed, lest the Markgraf of Wurtemburg should represent the
affray in the light of an outrage against a member of the
League.</p>
<p>Christina saw the necessity, and undertook if possible to
obtain her son&rsquo;s signature, but, at the first mention of
Master Moritz and the bridge, Ebbo turned away his head, groaned,
and begged to hear no more of either.&nbsp; He thought of his
bold declaration that the bridge must be built, even at the cost
of blood!&nbsp; Little did he then guess of whose blood!&nbsp;
And in his bitterness of spirit he felt a jealousy of that
influence of Schleiermacher, which had of late come between him
and his brother.&nbsp; He hated the very name, he said, and hid
his face with a shudder.&nbsp; He hoped the torrent would sweep
away every fragment of the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Ebbo mine, wherefore wish ill to a good work that
our blessed one loved?&nbsp; Listen, and let me tell you my dream
for making yonder strand a peaceful memorial of our peaceful
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To honour Friedel?&rdquo; and he gazed on her with
something like interest in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ebbo, and as he would best brook honour.&nbsp; Let
us seek for ever to end the rival claims to yon piece of meadow
by praying this knight of a religious order, the new count, to
unite with us in building there&mdash;or as near as may be
safe&mdash;a church of holy peace, and a cell for a priest, who
may watch over the bridge ward, and offer the holy sacrifice for
the departed of either house.&nbsp; There will we place our
gentle Friedel to be the first to guard the peace of the ford,
and there will we sleep ourselves when our time shall come, and
so may the cruel feud of many generations be slaked for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his blood!&rdquo; sighed Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!
would that it had been mine, mother.&nbsp; It is well, as well as
anything can be again.&nbsp; So shall the spot where he fell be
made sacred, and fenced from rude feet, and we shall see his fair
effigy keeping his armed watch there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Christina was thankful to see his look of gratification,
sad though it was.&nbsp; She sat down near his bed, and began to
write a letter in their joint names to Graf Dankwart von
Schlangenwald, proposing that thus, after the even balance of the
wrongs of the two houses, their mutual hostility might be laid to
rest for ever by the consecration of the cause of their long
contention.&nbsp; It was a stiff and formal letter, full of the
set pious formularies of the age, scarcely revealing the deep
heart-feeling within; but it was to the purpose, and Ebbo, after
hearing it read, heartily approved, and consented to sign both it
and those that Schleiermacher had brought.&nbsp; Christina held
the scroll, and placed the pen in the fingers that had lately so
easily wielded the heavy sword, but now felt it a far greater
effort to guide the slender quill.</p>
<p>Moritz Schleiermacher went his way in search of the King of
the Romans, far off in Carinthia.&nbsp; A full reply could not be
expected till the campaign was over, and all that was known for
some time was through a messenger sent back to Ulm by
Schleiermacher with the intelligence that Maximilian would
examine into the matter after his return, and that Count Dankwart
would reply when he should come to perform his father&rsquo;s
obsequies after the army was dispersed.&nbsp; There was also a
letter of kind though courtly condolence from Kasimir of
Wildschloss, much grieving for gallant young Sir Friedmund,
proffering all the advocacy he could give the cause of
Adlerstein, and covertly proffering the protection that she and
her remaining son might now be more disposed to accept.&nbsp;
Christina suppressed this letter, knowing it would only pain and
irritate Ebbo, and that she had her answer ready.&nbsp; Indeed,
in her grief for one son, and her anxiety for the other, perhaps
it was this letter that first made her fully realize the drift of
those earnest words of Friedel&rsquo;s respecting his father.</p>
<p>Meantime the mother and son were alone together, with much of
suffering and of sorrow, yet with a certain tender comfort in the
being all in all to one another, with none to intermeddle with
their mutual love and grief.&nbsp; It was to Christina as if
something of Friedel&rsquo;s sweetness had passed to his brother
in his patient helplessness, and that, while thus fully engrossed
with him, she had both her sons in one.&nbsp; Nay, in spite of
all the pain, grief, and weariness, these were times when both
dreaded any change, and the full recovery, when not only would
the loss of Friedel be every moment freshly brought home to his
brother, but when Ebbo would go in quest of his father.</p>
<p>For on this the young Baron had fixed his mind as a sacred
duty, from the moment he had seen that life was to be his
lot.&nbsp; He looked on his neglect of indications of the
possibility of his father&rsquo;s life in the light of a sin that
had led to all his disasters, and not only regarded the intended
search as a token of repentance, but as a charge bequeathed to
him by his less selfish brother.&nbsp; He seldom spoke of his
intention, but his mother was perfectly aware of it, and never
thought of it without such an agony of foreboding dread as
eclipsed all the hope that lay beyond.&nbsp; She could only turn
away her mind from the thought, and be thankful for what was
still her own from day to day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art weary, my son?&rdquo; asked Christina one October
afternoon, as Ebbo lay on his bed, languidly turning the pages of
a noble folio of the Legends of the Saints that Master Gottfried
had sent for his amusement.&nbsp; It was such a book as fixed the
ardour a few years later of the wounded Navarrese knight, Inigo
de Loyola, but Ebbo handled it as if each page were lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only thinking how Friedel would have glowed towards
these as his own kinsmen,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
should I have cared to read of them!&rdquo; and he gave a long
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take away the book,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou hast read long, and it is dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So dark that there must surely be a
snow-cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow is falling in the large flakes that our Friedel
used to call winter-butterflies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butterflies that will swarm and shut us in from the
weary world,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;And alack! when they
go, what a turmoil it will be!&nbsp; Councils in the Rathhaus,
appeals to the League, wranglings with the Markgraf, wise saws,
overweening speeches, all alike dull and dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will scarce be so when strength and spirit have
returned, mine Ebbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never can life be more to me than the way to
him,&rdquo; said the lonely boy; &ldquo;and I&mdash;never like
him&mdash;shall miss the road without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he thus spoke in the listless dejection of sorrow and
weakness, Hatto&rsquo;s aged step was on the stair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gracious lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is a huntsman
bewildered in the hills, who has been asking shelter from the
storm that is drifting up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See to his entertainment, then, Hatto,&rdquo; said the
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady&mdash;Sir Baron,&rdquo; added Hatto, &ldquo;I
had not come up but that this guest seems scarce gear for us
below.&nbsp; He is none of the foresters of our tract.&nbsp; His
hair is perfumed, his shirt is fine holland, his buff suit is of
softest skin, his baldric has a jewelled clasp, and his
arblast!&nbsp; It would do my lord baron&rsquo;s heart good only
to cast eyes on the perfect make of that arblast!&nbsp; He has a
lordly tread, and a stately presence, and, though he has a free
tongue, and made friends with us as he dried his garments, he
asked after my lord like his equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O mother, must you play the chatelaine?&rdquo; asked
Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who can the fellow be?&nbsp; Why did none ever
so come when they would have been more welcome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcomed must he be,&rdquo; said Christina, rising,
&ldquo;and thy state shall be my excuse for not tarrying longer
with him than may be needful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, though shrinking from a stranger&rsquo;s face, she was
not without hope that the variety might wholesomely rouse her son
from his depression, and in effect Ebbo, when left with Hatto,
minutely questioned him on the appearance of the stranger, and
watched, with much curiosity, for his mother&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ebbo mine,&rdquo; she said, entering, after a long
interval, &ldquo;the knight asks to see thee either after supper,
or to-morrow morn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a knight he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, truly, a knight truly in every look and gesture,
bearing his head like the leading stag of the herd, and yet right
gracious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious to you, mother, in your own hall?&rdquo; cried
Ebbo, almost fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! jealous champion, thou couldst not take
offence!&nbsp; It was the manner of one free and courteous to
every one, and yet with an inherent loftiness that pervades
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gives he no name?&rdquo; said Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He calls himself Ritter Theurdank, of the suite of the
late Kaisar, but I should deem him wont rather to lead than to
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theurdank,&rdquo; repeated Eberhard, &ldquo;I know no
such name!&nbsp; So, motherling, are you going to sup?&nbsp; I
shall not sleep till I have seen him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, dear son.&rdquo;&nbsp; She leant over him and
spoke low.&nbsp; &ldquo;See him thou must, but let me first
station Heinz and Koppel at the door with halberts, not within
earshot, but thou art so entirely defenceless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had the pleasure of seeing him laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Less
defenceless than when the kinsman of Wildschloss here visited us,
mother?&nbsp; I see for whom thou takest him, but let it be so; a
spiritual knight would scarce wreak his vengeance on a wounded
man in his bed.&nbsp; I will not have him insulted with
precautions.&nbsp; If he has freely risked himself in my hands, I
will as freely risk myself in his.&nbsp; Moreover, I thought he
had won thy heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reigned over it, rather,&rdquo; said Christina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is but the disguise that I suspect and mistrust.&nbsp;
Bid me not leave thee alone with him, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, dear mother,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;the matters
on which he is like to speak will brook no presence save our own,
and even that will be hard enough to bear.&nbsp; So prop me more
upright!&nbsp; So!&nbsp; And comb out these locks somewhat
smoother.&nbsp; Thanks, mother.&nbsp; Now can he see whether he
will choose Eberhard of Adlerstein for friend or foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time supper was ended, the only light in the upper room
came from the flickering flames of the fire of pine knots on the
hearth.&nbsp; It glanced on the pale features and dark sad eyes
of the young Baron, sad in spite of the eager look of scrutiny
that he turned on the figure that entered at the door, and
approached so quickly that the partial light only served to show
the gloss of long fair hair, the glint of a jewelled belt, and
the outline of a tall, well-knit, agile frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Herr Ritter,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am sorry
we have been unable to give you a fitter reception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No host could be more fully excused than you,&rdquo;
said the stranger, and Ebbo started at his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
fear you have suffered much, and still have much to
suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sword wound is healing fast,&rdquo; said Ebbo;
&ldquo;it is the shot in my broken thigh that is so tedious and
painful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I dare be sworn the leeches made it worse.&nbsp; I
have hated all leeches ever since they kept me three days a
prisoner in a &rsquo;pothecary&rsquo;s shop stinking with
drugs.&nbsp; Why, I have cured myself with one pitcher of water
of a raging fever, in their very despite!&nbsp; How did they
serve thee, my poor boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They poured hot oil into the wound to remove the venom
of the lead,&rdquo; said Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had it been my case the lead should have been in their
own brains first, though that were scarce needed, the
heavy-witted Hans Sausages.&nbsp; Why should there be more poison
in lead than in steel?&nbsp; I have asked all my surgeons that
question, nor ever had a reasonable answer.&nbsp; Greater havoc
of warriors do they make than ever with the arquebus&mdash;ay,
even when every lanzknecht bears one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alack!&rdquo; Ebbo could not help exclaiming,
&ldquo;where will be room for chivalry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk not old world nonsense,&rdquo; said Theurdank;
&ldquo;chivalry is in the heart, not in the weapon.&nbsp; A youth
beforehand enough with the world to be building bridges should
know that, when all our troops are provided with such an arm,
then will their platoons in serried ranks be as a solid wall
breathing fire, and as impregnable as the lines of English
archers with long bows, or the phalanx of Macedon.&nbsp; And,
when each man bears a pistol instead of the misericorde, his life
will be far more his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo&rsquo;s face was in full light, and his visitor marked
his contracted brow and trembling lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;thou hast had foul experience of these
weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mine own hurt,&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;that was
but fair chance of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;it was the
shot that severed the goodly bond that was so fair to see.&nbsp;
Young man, none has grieved more truly than King Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And well he may,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has
not lost merely one of his best servants, but all the better half
of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is still stuff enough left to make that
<i>one</i> well worth having,&rdquo; said Theurdank, kindly
grasping his hand, &ldquo;though I would it were more
substantial!&nbsp; How didst get old Wolfgang down, boy?&nbsp; He
must have been a tough morsel for slight bones like these, even
when better covered than now.&nbsp; Come, tell me all.&nbsp; I
promised the Markgraf of Wurtemburg to look into the matter when
I came to be guest at St. Ruprecht&rsquo;s cloister, and I have
some small interest too with King Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His kindliness and sympathy were more effectual with Ebbo than
the desire to represent his case favourably, for he was still too
wretched to care for policy; but he answered Theurdank&rsquo;s
questions readily, and explained how the idea of the bridge had
originated in the vigil beside the broken waggons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Theurdank, &ldquo;the merchants
made up thy share?&nbsp; These overthrown goods are a seignorial
right of one or other of you lords of the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Herr Ritter; but we deemed it unknightly to
snatch at what travellers lost by misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freiherr Eberhard, take my word for it, while thou thus
holdest, all the arquebuses yet to be cut out of the Black Forest
will not mar thy chivalry.&nbsp; Where didst get these ways of
thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother was a very St. Sebastian!&nbsp; My
mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! her sweet wise face would have shown it, even had
not poor Kasimir of Adlerstein raved of her.&nbsp; Ah! lad, thou
hast crossed a case of true love there!&nbsp; Canst not brook
even such a gallant stepfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not,&rdquo; said Ebbo, with spirit; &ldquo;for
with his last breath Schlangenwald owned that my own father died
not at the hostel, but may now be alive as a Turkish
slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; burst out Theurdank.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well! that might have been a pretty mess!&nbsp; A Turkish
slave, saidst thou!&nbsp; What year chanced all this
matter&mdash;thy grandfather&rsquo;s murder and all the
rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The year before my birth,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was in the September of 1475.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; muttered Theurdank, musing to himself;
&ldquo;that was the year the dotard Schenk got his overthrow at
the fight of Rain on Sare from the Moslem.&nbsp; Some composition
was made by them, and old Wolfgang was not unlikely to have been
the go-between.&nbsp; So!&nbsp; Say on, young knight,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;let us to the matter in hand.&nbsp; How rose the
strife that kept back two troops from our&mdash;from the banner
of the empire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo proceeded with the narration, and concluded it just as
the bell now belonging to the chapel began to toll for compline,
and Theurdank prepared to obey its summons, first, however,
asking if he should send any one to the patient.&nbsp; Ebbo
thanked him, but said he needed no one till his mother should
come after prayers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I told thee I had some leechcraft.&nbsp; Thou art
weary, and must rest more entirely;&rdquo;&mdash;and, giving him
little choice, Theurdank supported him with one arm while
removing the pillows that propped him, then laid him tenderly
down, saying, &ldquo;Good night, and the saints bless thee, brave
young knight.&nbsp; Sleep well, and recover in spite of the
leeches.&nbsp; I cannot afford to lose both of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo strove to follow mentally the services that were being
performed in the chapel, and whose &ldquo;Amens&rdquo; and louder
notes pealed up to him, devoid of the clear young tones that had
sung their last here below, but swelled by grand bass notes that
as much distracted Ebbo&rsquo;s attention as the memory of his
guest&rsquo;s conversation; and he impatiently awaited his
mother&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>At length, lamp in hand, she appeared with tears shining in
her eyes, and bending over him said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hath done honour to our blessed one, my Ebbo; he
knelt by him, and crossed him with holy water, and when he led me
from the chapel he told me any mother in Germany might envy me my
two sons even now.&nbsp; Thou must love him now, Ebbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love him as one loves one&rsquo;s loftiest
model,&rdquo; said Ebbo&mdash;&ldquo;value the old castle the
more for sheltering him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hath he made himself known to thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not openly, but there is only one that he can
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina smiled, thankful that the work of pardon and
reconciliation had been thus softened by the personal qualities
of the enemy, whose conduct in the chapel had deeply moved
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all will be well, blessedly well,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I trust,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;but the bell broke
our converse, and he laid me down as tenderly as&mdash;O mother,
if a father&rsquo;s kindness be like his, I have truly somewhat
to regain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew he aught of the fell bargain?&rdquo; whispered
Christina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he, of course, save that it was a year of Turkish
inroads.&nbsp; He will speak more perchance to-morrow.&nbsp;
Mother, not a word to any one, nor let us betray our recognition
unless it be his pleasure to make himself known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Christina, remembering the
danger that the household might revenge Friedel&rsquo;s death if
they knew the foe to be in their power.&nbsp; Knowing as she did
that Ebbo&rsquo;s admiration was apt to be enthusiastic, and
might now be rendered the more fervent by fever and solitude, she
was still at a loss to understand his dazzled, fascinated
state.</p>
<p>When Heinz entered, bringing the castle key, which was always
laid under the Baron&rsquo;s pillow, Ebbo made a movement with
his hand that surprised them both, as if to send it
elsewhere&mdash;then muttered, &ldquo;No, no, not till he reveals
himself,&rdquo; and asked, &ldquo;Where sleeps the
guest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the grandmother&rsquo;s room, which we fitted for a
guest-chamber, little thinking who our first would be,&rdquo;
said his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear, lady; we will have a care to him,&rdquo;
said Heinz, somewhat grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, have a care,&rdquo; said Ebbo, wearily; &ldquo;and
take care all due honour is shown to him!&nbsp; Good night,
Heinz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious lady,&rdquo; said Heinz, when by a sign he had
intimated to her his desire of speaking with her unobserved by
the Baron, &ldquo;never fear; I know who the fellow is as well as
you do.&nbsp; I shall be at the foot of the stairs, and woe to
whoever tries to step up them past me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no reason to apprehend treason, Heinz, yet to
be on our guard can do no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lady, I could look to the gear for the oubliette
if you would speak the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, no, Heinz.&nbsp; This man has
come hither trusting to our honour, and you could not do your
lord a greater wrong, nor one that he could less pardon, than by
any attempt on our guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that he had never eaten our bread!&rdquo;
muttered Heinz.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vipers be they all, and who knows
what may come next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch, watch, Heinz; that is all,&rdquo; implored
Christina, &ldquo;and, above all, not a word to any one
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Christina dismissed the man-at-arms gruff and sullen, and
herself retired ill at ease between fears of, and for, the
unwelcome guest whose strange powers of fascination had rendered
her, in his absence, doubly distrustful.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">RITTER THEURDANK</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> snow fell all night without
ceasing, and was still falling on the morrow, when the guest
explained his desire of paying a short visit to the young Baron,
and then taking his departure.&nbsp; Christina would gladly have
been quit of him, but she felt bound to remonstrate, for their
mountain was absolutely impassable during a fall of snow, above
all when accompanied by wind, since the drifts concealed fearful
abysses, and the shifting masses insured destruction to the
unwary wayfarer; nay, natives themselves had perished between the
hamlet and the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the hardiest cragsman, not my son himself,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;could venture on such a morning to guide you
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither, gracious dame?&rdquo; asked Theurdank, half
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir, I would not utter what you would not make
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know me then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, sir, for our noble foe, whose generous trust in
our honour must win my son&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said, with a peculiar smile,
&ldquo;Theurdank&mdash;Dankwart&mdash;I see!&nbsp; May I ask if
your son likewise smelt out the Schlangenwald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, Sir Count, my Ebbo is not easily
deceived.&nbsp; He said our guest could be but one man in all the
empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theurdank smiled again, saying, &ldquo;Then, lady, you shudder
not at a man whose kin and yours have shed so much of one
another&rsquo;s blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, ghostly knight, I regard you as no more stained
therewith than are my sons by the deeds of their
grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there were more like you, lady,&rdquo; returned
Theurdank, &ldquo;deadly feuds would soon be starved out.&nbsp;
May I to your son?&nbsp; I have more to say to him, and I would
fain hear his views of the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina could not be quite at ease with Theurdank in her
son&rsquo;s room, but she had no choice, and she knew that Heinz
was watching on the turret stair, out of hearing indeed, but as
ready to spring as a cat who sees her young ones in the hand of a
child that she only half trusts.</p>
<p>Ebbo lay eagerly watching for his visitor, who greeted him
with the same almost paternal kindness he had evinced the night
before, but consulted him upon the way from the castle.&nbsp;
Ebbo confirmed his mother&rsquo;s opinion that the path was
impracticable so long as the snow fell, and the wind tossed it in
wild drifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been caught in snow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
hard work have we had to get home!&nbsp; Once indeed, after a
bear hunt, we fully thought the castle stood before us, and lo!
it was all a cruel snow mist in that mocking shape.&nbsp; I was
even about to climb our last Eagle&rsquo;s Step, as I thought,
when behold, it proved to be the very brink of the
abyss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! these ravines are well-nigh as bad as those of the
Inn.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known what it was to be caught on the ledge
of a precipice by a sharp wind, changing its course,
mark&rsquo;st thou, so swiftly that it verily tore my hold from
the rock, and had well-nigh swept me into a chasm of mighty
depth.&nbsp; There was nothing for it but to make the best spring
I might towards the crag on the other side, and grip for my life
at my alpenstock, which by Our Lady&rsquo;s grace was firmly
planted, and I held on till I got breath again, and felt for my
footing on the ice-glazed rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Eberhard with a long breath, after
having listened with a hunter&rsquo;s keen interest to this
hair&rsquo;s-breadth escape, &ldquo;it sounds like a gust of my
mountain air thus let in on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly it is dismal work for a lusty hunter to lie
here,&rdquo; said Theurdank, &ldquo;but soon shalt thou take thy
crags again in full vigour, I hope.&nbsp; How call&rsquo;st thou
the deep gray lonely pool under a steep frowning crag sharpened
well-nigh to a spear point, that I passed yester
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ptarmigan&rsquo;s Mere, the Red Eyrie,&rdquo;
murmured Ebbo, scarcely able to utter the words as he thought of
Friedel&rsquo;s delight in the pool, his exploit at the eyrie,
and the gay bargain made in the streets of Ulm, that he should
show the scaler of the Dom steeple the way to the eagle&rsquo;s
nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said his guest gravely, coming to
his side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, boy! thy brother&rsquo;s flight has
been higher yet.&nbsp; Weep freely; fear me not.&nbsp; Do I not
know what it is, when those who were over-good for earth have
found their eagle&rsquo;s wings, and left us here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo gazed up through his tears into the noble, mournful face
that was bent kindly over him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not seek to
comfort thee by counselling thee to forget,&rdquo; said
Theurdank.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was scarce thine elder when my life was
thus rent asunder, and to hoar hairs, nay, to the grave itself,
will she be my glory and my sorrow.&nbsp; Never owned I brother,
but I trow ye two were one in no common sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such brothers as we saw at Ulm were little like
us,&rdquo; returned Ebbo, from the bottom of his heart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We were knit together so that all will begin with me as if
it were the left hand remaining alone to do it!&nbsp; I am glad
that my old life may not even in shadow be renewed till after I
have gone in quest of my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not over hasty in that quest,&rdquo; said the guest,
&ldquo;or the infidels may chance to gain two Freiherren instead
of one.&nbsp; Hast any designs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo explained that he thought of making his way to Genoa to
consult the merchant Gian Battista dei Battiste, whose
description of the captive German noble had so strongly impressed
Friedel.&nbsp; Ebbo knew the difference between Turks and Moors,
but Friedel&rsquo;s impulse guided him, and he further thought
that at Genoa he should learn the way to deal with either variety
of infidel.&nbsp; Theurdank thought this a prudent course, since
the Genoese had dealings both at Tripoli and Constantinople; and,
moreover, the transfer was not impossible, since the two
different hordes of Moslems trafficked among themselves when
either had made an unusually successful razzia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame,&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;that these Eastern
locusts, these ravening hounds, should prey unmolested on the
fairest lands of the earth, and our German nobles lie here like
swine, grunting and squealing over the plunder they grub up from
one another, deaf to any summons from heaven or earth!&nbsp; Did
not Heaven&rsquo;s own voice speak in thunder this last year,
even in November, hurling the mighty thunderbolt of Alsace, an
ell long, weighing two hundred and fifteen pounds?&nbsp; Did I
not cause it to be hung up in the church of Encisheim, as a
witness and warning of the plagues that hang over us?&nbsp; But
no, nothing will quicken them from their sloth and drunkenness
till the foe are at their doors; and, if a man arise of different
mould, with some heart for the knightly, the good, and the true,
then they kill him for me!&nbsp; But thou, Adlerstein, this pious
quest over, thou wilt return to me.&nbsp; Thou hast head to think
and heart to feel for the shame and woe of this misguided
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust so, my lord,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Truly, I have suffered bitterly for pursuing my own
quarrel rather than the crusade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant not thee,&rdquo; said Theurdank, kindly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thy bridge is a benefit to me, as much as, or more than,
ever it can be to thee.&nbsp; Dost know Italian?&nbsp; There is
something of Italy in thine eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s mother was Italian, my lord; but she
died so early that her language has not descended to my mother or
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shouldst learn it.&nbsp; It will be pastime while
thou art bed-fast, and serve thee well in dealing with the
Moslem.&nbsp; Moreover, I may have work for thee in
Welschland.&nbsp; Books?&nbsp; I will send thee books.&nbsp;
There is the whole chronicle of Karl the Great, and all his
Palsgrafen, by Pulci and Boiardo, a brave Count and gentleman
himself, governor of Reggio, and worthy to sing of deeds of arms;
so choice, too, as to the names of his heroes, that they say he
caused his church bells to be rung when he had found one for
Rodomonte, his infidel Hector.&nbsp; He has shown up Roland as a
love-sick knight, though, which is out of all accord with
Archbishop Turpin.&nbsp; Wilt have him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we were together, we used to love tales of
chivalry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Or wilt have the stern old Ghibelline
Florentine, who explored the three realms of the departed?&nbsp;
Deep lore, and well-nigh unsearchable, is his; but I love him for
the sake of his Beatrice, who guided him.&nbsp; May we find such
guides in our day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of him,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
he will tell me where my Friedel walks in light, then, my lord, I
would read him with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or wouldst thou have rare Franciscus Petrarca?&nbsp; I
wot thou art too young as yet for the yearnings of his sonnets,
but their voice is sweet to the bereft heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he murmured over, in their melodious Italian flow, the
lines on Laura&rsquo;s death:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not pallid, but yet whiter than the snow<br
/>
By wind unstirred that on a hillside lies;<br />
Rest seemed as on a weary frame to grow,<br />
A gentle slumber pressed her lovely eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he added aloud to himself, &ldquo;it is ever
to me as though the poet had watched in that chamber at
Ghent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the discourses of that morning, now on poetry and
book lore; now admiration of the carvings that decked the room;
now talk on grand architectural designs, or improvements in
fire-arms, or the discussion of hunting adventures.&nbsp; There
seemed nothing in art, life, or learning in which the versatile
mind of Theurdank was not at home, or that did not end in some
strange personal reminiscence of his own.&nbsp; All was so kind,
so gracious, and brilliant, that at first the interview was full
of wondering delight to Ebbo, but latterly it became very
fatiguing from the strain of attention, above all towards a guest
who evidently knew that he was known, while not permitting such
recognition to be avowed.&nbsp; Ebbo began to long for an
interruption, but, though he could see by the lightened sky that
the weather had cleared up, it would have been impossible to have
suggested to any guest that the way might now probably be open,
and more especially to such a guest as this.&nbsp; Considerate as
his visitor had been the night before, the pleasure of talk
seemed to have done away with the remembrance of his host&rsquo;s
weakness, till Ebbo so flagged that at last he was scarcely alive
to more than the continued sound of the voice, and all the pain
that for a while had been in abeyance seemed to have mastered
him; but his guest, half reading his books, half discoursing,
seemed too much immersed in his own plans, theories, and
adventures, to mark the condition of his auditor.</p>
<p>Interruption came at last, however.&nbsp; There was a sudden
knock at the door at noon, and with scant ceremony Heinz entered,
followed by three other of the men-at-arms, fully equipped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! what means this?&rdquo; demanded Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, Sir Baron,&rdquo; said Heinz, advancing so as to
place his large person between Ebbo&rsquo;s bed and the strange
hunter.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know nothing of it.&nbsp; We are not
going to lose you as well as your brother, and we mean to see how
this knight likes to serve as a hostage instead of opening the
gates as a traitor spy.&nbsp; On him, Koppel! it is thy
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands off! at your peril, villains!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ebbo, sitting up, and speaking in the steady resolute voice that
had so early rendered him thoroughly their master, but much
perplexed and dismayed, and entirely unassisted by Theurdank, who
stood looking on with almost a smile, as if diverted by his
predicament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your leave, Herr Freiherr,&rdquo; said Heinz,
putting his hand on his shoulder, &ldquo;this is no concern of
yours.&nbsp; While you cannot guard yourself or my lady, it is
our part to do so.&nbsp; I tell you his minions are on their way
to surprise the castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as Heinz spoke, Christina came panting into the room,
and, hurrying to her son&rsquo;s side, said, &ldquo;Sir Count, is
this just, is this honourable, thus to return my son&rsquo;s
welcome, in his helpless condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, are you likewise distracted?&rdquo; exclaimed
Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is all this madness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, my son, it is no frenzy!&nbsp; There are armed
men coming up the Eagle&rsquo;s Stairs on the one hand and by the
Gemsbock&rsquo;s Pass on the other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not a hair of your head shall they hurt,
lady,&rdquo; said Heinz.&nbsp; &ldquo;This fellow&rsquo;s limbs
shall be thrown to them over the battlements.&nbsp; On,
Koppel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off, Koppel!&rdquo; thundered Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would
you brand me with shame for ever?&nbsp; Were he all the
Schlangenwalds in one, he should go as freely as he came; but he
is no more Schlangenwald than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has deceived you, my lord,&rdquo; said Heinz.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My lady&rsquo;s own letter to Schlangenwald was in his
chamber.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a treacherous disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool that thou art!&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know this gentleman well.&nbsp; I knew him at Ulm.&nbsp; Those
who meet him here mean me no ill.&nbsp; Open the gates and
receive them honourably!&nbsp; Mother, mother, trust me, all is
well.&nbsp; I know what I am saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men looked one upon another.&nbsp; Christina wrung her
hands, uncertain whether her son were not under some strange
fatal deception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord has his fancies,&rdquo; growled Koppel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be balked of my right of vengeance for his
scruples!&nbsp; Will he swear that this fellow is what he calls
himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear,&rdquo; said Ebbo, slowly, &ldquo;that he is a
true loyal knight, well known to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear it distinctly, Sir Baron,&rdquo; said
Heinz.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have all too deep a debt of vengeance to
let off any one who comes here lurking in the interest of our
foe.&nbsp; Swear that this is Theurdank, or we send his head to
greet his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drops stood on Ebbo&rsquo;s brow, and his breath laboured as
he felt his senses reeling, and his powers of defence for his
guest failing him.&nbsp; Even should the stranger confess his
name, the people of the castle might not believe him; and here he
stood like one indifferent, evidently measuring how far his young
host would go in his cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot swear that his real name is Theurdank,&rdquo;
said Ebbo, rallying his forces, &ldquo;but this I swear, that he
is neither friend nor fosterer of Schlangenwald, that I know him,
and I had rather die than that the slightest indignity were
offered him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, and with a great effort that
terribly wrenched his wounded leg, he reached past Heinz, and
grasped his guest&rsquo;s hand, pulling him as near as he
could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if they try to lay hands on
you, strike my death-blow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bugle-horn was wound outside.&nbsp; The men stood
daunted&mdash;Christina in extreme terror for her son, who lay
gasping, breathless, but still clutching the stranger&rsquo;s
hand, and with eyes of fire glaring on the mutinous
warriors.&nbsp; Another bugle-blast!&nbsp; Heinz was almost in
the act of grappling with the silent foe, and Koppel cried as he
raised his halbert, &ldquo;Now or never!&rdquo; but paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, so please you,&rdquo; said the strange
guest.&nbsp; &ldquo;What if your young lord could not forswear
himself that my name is Theurdank!&nbsp; Are you foes to all the
world save Theurdank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No masking,&rdquo; said Heinz, sternly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell your true name as an honest man, and we will judge
whether you be friend or foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is a mouthful, as your master knows,&rdquo;
said the guest, slowly, looking with strangely amused eyes on the
confused lanzknechts, who were trying to devour their rage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was baptized Maximilianus; Archduke of Austria, by
birth; by choice of the Germans, King of the Romans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kaisar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina dropped on her knee; the men-at-arms tumbled
backwards; Ebbo pressed the hand he held to his lips, and fainted
away.&nbsp; The bugle sounded for the third time.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PEACE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Slowly</span> and painfully did Ebbo
recover from his swoon, feeling as if the means of revival were
rending him away from his brother.&nbsp; He was so completely
spent that he was satisfied with a mere assurance that nothing
was amiss, and presently dropped into a profound slumber, whence
he awoke to find it still broad daylight, and his mother sitting
by the side of his bed, all looking so much as it had done for
the last six weeks, that his first inquiry was if all that had
happened had been but a strange dream.&nbsp; His mother would
scarcely answer till she had satisfied herself that his eye was
clear, his voice steady, his hand cool, and that, as she said,
&ldquo;That Kaisar had done him no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then it was true!&nbsp; Where is he?&nbsp;
Gone?&rdquo; cried Ebbo, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, in the hall below, busy with letters they have
brought him.&nbsp; Lie still, my boy; he has done thee quite
enough damage for one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mother, what are you saying!&nbsp; Something
disloyal, was it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ebbo, I was very angry that he should have half
killed you when he could so easily have spoken one word.&nbsp;
Heaven forgive me if I did wrong, but I could not help
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did <i>he</i> forgive you, mother?&rdquo; said Ebbo,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;oh yes.&nbsp; To do him justice he was greatly
concerned; devised ways of restoring thee, and now has promised
not to come near thee again without my leave,&rdquo; said the
mother, quite as persuaded of her own rightful sway in her
son&rsquo;s sick chamber as ever Kunigunde had been of her
dominion over the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is he displeased with me?&nbsp; Those cowardly
vindictive rascals, to fall on him, and set me at nought!&nbsp;
Before him, too!&rdquo; exclaimed Ebbo, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Ebbo, he thought thy part most gallant.&nbsp; I
heard him say so, not only to me, but below stairs&mdash;both
wise and true.&nbsp; Thou didst know him then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the first glance of his princely eye&mdash;the
first of his keen smiles.&nbsp; I had seen him disguised
before.&nbsp; I thought you knew him too, mother; I never guessed
that your mind was running on Schlangenwald when we talked at
cross purposes last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that I had; but though I breathed no word openly,
I encouraged Heinz&rsquo;s precautions.&nbsp; My boy, I could not
help it; my heart would tremble for my only one, and I saw he
could not be what he seemed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what doth he here?&nbsp; Who were the men who were
advancing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were the followers he had left at St.
Ruprecht&rsquo;s, and likewise Master Schleiermacher and Sir
Kasimir of Wildschloss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;he had not told thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; He knew that I knew him, was at no pains to
disguise himself, yet evidently meant me to treat him as a
private knight.&nbsp; But what brought Wildschloss
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said Christina, &ldquo;that, on the
return from Carinthia, the Kaisar expressed his intention of
slipping away from his army in his own strange fashion, and
himself inquiring into the matter of the Ford.&nbsp; So he took
with him his own personal followers, the new Graf von
Schlangenwald, Herr Kasimir, and Master Schleiermacher.&nbsp; The
others he sent to Schlangenwald; he himself lodged at St.
Ruprecht&rsquo;s, appointing that Sir Kasimir should meet him
there this morning.&nbsp; From the convent he started on a
chamois hunt, and made his way hither; but, when the snow came
on, and he returned not, his followers became uneasy, and came in
search of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;he meant to intercede for
Wildschloss&mdash;it might be he would have tried his
power.&nbsp; No, for that he is too generous.&nbsp; How looked
Wildschloss, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I tell how any one looked save thee, my poor
wan boy?&nbsp; Thou art paler than ever!&nbsp; I cannot have any
king or kaisar of them all come to trouble thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, motherling, there is much more trouble and unrest
to me in not knowing how my king will treat us after such a
requital!&nbsp; Prithee let him know that I am at his
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, after having fed and refreshed her patient, the gentle
potentate of his chamber consented to intimate her consent to
admit the invader.&nbsp; But not till after delay enough to fret
the impatient nerves of illness did Maximilian appear, handing
her in, and saying, in the cheery voice that was one of his chief
fascinations,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, truly, fair dame, I know thou wouldst sooner trust
Schlangenwald himself than me alone with thy charge.&nbsp; How
goes it, my true knight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, right well, my liege,&rdquo; said Ebbo,
&ldquo;save for my shame and grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art the last to be ashamed for that,&rdquo; said
the good-natured prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I never seen my
faithful vassals more bent on their own feuds than on my
word?&mdash;I who reign over a set of kings, who brook no will
but their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may we ask your pardon,&rdquo; said Ebbo,
&ldquo;not only for ourselves, but for the misguided
men-at-arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! the grewsome giant that was prepared with the
axe, and the honest lad that wanted to do his duty by his
father?&nbsp; I honour that lad, Freiherr; I would enrol him in
my guard, but that probably he is better off here than with
<i>Massimiliano pochi danari</i>, as the Italians call me.&nbsp;
But what I came hither to say was this,&rdquo; and he spoke
gravely: &ldquo;thou art sincere in desiring reconciliation with
the house of Schlangenwald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;do I loathe
the miserable debt of blood for blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Maximilian, &ldquo;Graf Dankwart is of
like mind.&nbsp; Bred from pagedom in his Prussian commandery, he
has never been exposed to the irritations that have fed the
spirit of strife, and he will be thankful to lay it aside.&nbsp;
The question next is how to solemnize this reconciliation, ere
your retainers on one side or the other do something to set you
by the ears together again, which, judging by this
morning&rsquo;s work, is not improbable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! no,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;while I am laid
by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you both been in our camp, you should have sworn
friendship in my chapel.&nbsp; Now must Dankwart come hither to
thee, as I trow he had best do, while I am here to keep the
peace.&nbsp; See, friend Ebbo, we will have him here to-morrow;
thy chaplain shall deck the altar here, the Father Abbot shall
say mass, and ye shall swear peace and brotherhood before
me.&nbsp; And,&rdquo; he added, taking Ebbo&rsquo;s hand,
&ldquo;I shall know how to trust thine oaths as of one who sets
the fear of God above that of his king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was truly the only chance of impressing on the wild
vassals of the two houses an obligation that perhaps might
override their ancient hatred; and the Baron and his mother
gladly submitted to the arrangement.&nbsp; Maximilian withdrew to
give directions for summoning the persons required and Christina
was soon obliged to leave her son, while she provided for her
influx of guests.</p>
<p>Ebbo was alone till nearly the end of the supper below
stairs.&nbsp; He had been dozing, when a cautious tread came up
the turret steps, and he started, and called out, &ldquo;Who goes
there?&nbsp; I am not asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your kinsman, Freiherr,&rdquo; said a well-known
voice; &ldquo;I come by your mother&rsquo;s leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Sir Cousin,&rdquo; said Ebbo, holding out his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;You come to find everything
changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have knelt in the chapel,&rdquo; said Wildschloss,
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he loved you better than I!&rdquo; said Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your jealousy of me was a providential thing, for which
all may be thankful,&rdquo; said Wildschloss gravely; &ldquo;yet
it is no small thing to lose the hope of so many years!&nbsp;
However, young Baron, I have grave matter for your
consideration.&nbsp; Know you the service on which I am to be
sent?&nbsp; The Kaisar deems that the Armenians or some of the
Christian nations on the skirts of the Ottoman empire might be
made our allies, and attack the Turk in his rear.&nbsp; I am
chosen as his envoy, and shall sail so soon as I can make my way
to Venice.&nbsp; I only knew of the appointment since I came
hither, he having been led thereto by letters brought him this
day; and mayhap by the downfall of my hopes.&nbsp; He was
peremptory, as his mood is, and seemed to think it no small
favour,&rdquo; added Wildschloss, with some annoyance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And meantime, what of my poor child?&nbsp; There she is in
the cloister at Ulm, but an inheritance is a very mill-stone
round the neck of an orphan maid.&nbsp; That insolent fellow,
Lassla von Trautbach, hath already demanded to espouse the poor
babe; he&mdash;a blood-stained, dicing, drunken rover, with whom
I would not trust a dog that I loved!&nbsp; Yet my death would
place her at the disposal of his father, who would give her at
once to him.&nbsp; Nay, even his aunt, the abbess, will believe
nothing against him, and hath even striven with me to have her
betrothed at once.&nbsp; On the barest rumour of my death will
they wed the poor little thing, and then woe to her, and woe to
my vassals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King,&rdquo; suggested Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely
she might be made his ward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Sir Kasimir, bending over him,
and speaking in an undertone, &ldquo;he may well have won your
heart.&nbsp; As friend, when one is at his side, none can be so
winning, or so sincere as he; but with all his brilliant gifts,
he says truly of himself that he is a mere reckless
huntsman.&nbsp; To-day, while I am with him, he would give me
half Austria, or fight single-handed in my cause or
Thekla&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Next month, when I am out of sight, comes
Trautbach, just when his head is full of keeping the French out
of Italy, or reforming the Church, or beating the Turk, or
parcelling the empire into circles, or, maybe, of a new
touch-hole for a cannon&mdash;nay, of a flower-garden, or of
walking into a lion&rsquo;s den.&nbsp; He just says, &lsquo;Yea,
well,&rsquo; to be rid of the importunity, and all is over with
my poor little maiden.&nbsp; Hare-brained and bewildered with
schemes has he been as Romish King&mdash;how will it be with him
as Kaisar?&nbsp; It is but of his wonted madness that he is here
at all, when his Austrian states must be all astray for want of
him.&nbsp; No, no; I would rather make a weathercock guardian to
my daughter.&nbsp; You yourself are the only guard to whom I can
safely intrust her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sword as knight and kinsman&mdash;&rdquo; began
Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; &rsquo;tis no matter of errant knight or
distressed damsel.&nbsp; That is King Max&rsquo;s own
line!&rdquo; said Wildschloss, with a little of the irony that
used to nettle Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is only one way in which
you can save her, and that is as her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo started, as well he might, but Sir Kasimir laid his hand
on him with a gesture that bade him listen ere he spoke.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My first wish for my child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was to
see her brought up by that peerless lady below stairs.&nbsp; The
saints&mdash;in pity to one so like themselves&mdash;spared her
the distress our union would have brought her.&nbsp; Now, it
would be vain to place my little Thekla in her care, for
Trautbach would easily feign my death, and claim his niece, nor
are you of age to be made her guardian as head of our
house.&nbsp; But, if this marriage rite were solemnized, then
would her person and lands alike be yours, and I could leave her
with an easy heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the confused, surprised Ebbo,
&ldquo;what can I do?&nbsp; They say I shall not walk for many
weeks to come.&nbsp; And, even if I could, I am so young&mdash;I
have so blundered in my dealings with my own mountaineers, and
with this fatal bridge&mdash;how should I manage such estates as
yours?&nbsp; Some better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you, Ebbo,&rdquo; said Wildschloss; &ldquo;you
have erred&mdash;you have been hasty; but tell me where to find
another youth, whose strongest purpose was as wise as your
errors, or who cared for others&rsquo; good more than for his own
violence and vainglory?&nbsp; Brief as your time has been, one
knows when one is on your bounds by the aspect of your serfs, the
soundness of their dwellings, the prosperity of their crops and
cattle above all, by their face and tone if one asks for their
lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! it was Friedel they loved.&nbsp; They scarce knew
me from Friedel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as you are, with all the blunders you have made
and will make, you are the only youth I know to whom I could
intrust my child or my lands.&nbsp; The old Wildschloss castle is
a male fief, and would return to you, but there are domains since
granted that will cause intolerable trouble and strife, unless
you and my poor little heiress are united.&nbsp; As for age, you
are&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen next Easter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there are scarce eleven years between you.&nbsp;
You will find the little one a blooming bride when your first
deeds in arms have been fought out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, if my mother trains her up,&rdquo; said Ebbo,
thoughtfully, &ldquo;she will be all the better daughter to
her.&nbsp; But, Sir Cousin, you know I too must be going.&nbsp;
So soon as I can brook the saddle, I must seek out and ransom my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is like to be a far shorter and safer journey than
mine.&nbsp; The Genoese and Venetians understand traffic with the
infidels for their captives, and only by your own fault could you
get into danger.&nbsp; Even at the worst, should mishap befall
you, you could so order matters as to leave your girl-widow in
your mother&rsquo;s charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; added Ebbo, &ldquo;she would still have
one left to love and cherish her.&nbsp; Sir Kasimir, it is well;
though, if you knew me without my Friedel, you would repent of
your bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks from my heart,&rdquo; said Wildschloss,
&ldquo;but you need not be concerned.&nbsp; You have never been
over-friendly with me even with Friedel at your side.&nbsp; But
to business, my son.&nbsp; You will endure that title from me
now?&nbsp; My time is short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have me do?&nbsp; Shall I send the
little one a betrothal ring, and ride to Ulm to wed and fetch her
home in spring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may hardly serve.&nbsp; These kinsmen would have
seized on her and the castle long ere that time.&nbsp; The only
safety is the making wedlock as fast as it can be made with a
child of such tender years.&nbsp; Mine is the only power that can
make the abbess give her up, and therefore will I ride this
moonlight night to Ulm, bring the little one back with me by the
time the reconciliation be concluded, and then shall ye be wed by
the Abbot of St. Ruprecht&rsquo;s, with the Kaisar for a witness,
and thus will the knot be too strong for the Trautbachs to
untie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo looked disconcerted, and gasped, as if this were
over-quick work.&mdash;&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Knows my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go to speak with her at once.&nbsp; The
Kaisar&rsquo;s consent I have, as he says, &lsquo;If we have one
vassal who has common sense and honesty, let us make the most of
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah! my son, I shall return to see you his
counsellor and friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those days had no delicacies as to the lady&rsquo;s side
taking the initiative: and, in effect, the wealth and power of
Wildschloss so much exceeded those of the elder branch that it
would have been presumptuous on Eberhard&rsquo;s part to have
made the proposal.&nbsp; It was more a treaty than an affair of
hearts, and Sir Kasimir had not even gone through the form of
inquiring if Ebbo were fancy-free.&nbsp; It was true, indeed,
that he was still a boy, with no passion for any one but his
mother; but had he even formed a dream of a ladye love, it would
scarcely have been deemed a rational objection.&nbsp; The days of
romance were no days of romance in marriage.</p>
<p>Yet Christina, wedded herself for pure love, felt this
obstacle strongly.&nbsp; The scheme was propounded to her over
the hall fire by no less a person than Maximilian himself, and
he, whose perceptions were extremely keen when he was not too
much engrossed to use them, observed her reluctance through all
her timid deference, and probed her reasons so successfully that
she owned at last that, though it might sound like folly, she
could scarce endure to see her son so bind himself that the
romance of his life could hardly be innocent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lady,&rdquo; was the answer, in a tone of deep
feeling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither lands nor honours can weigh down
the up-springing of true love;&rdquo; and he bowed his head
between his hands.</p>
<p>Verily, all the Low Countries had not impeded the true-hearted
affection of Maximilian and Mary; and, though since her death his
want of self-restraint had marred his personal character and
morals, and though he was now on the point of concluding a most
loveless political marriage, yet still Mary was&mdash;as he shows
her as the Beatrice of both his strange autobiographical
allegories&mdash;the guiding star of his fitful life; and in
heart his fidelity was so unbroken that, when after a long pause
he again looked up to Christina, he spoke as well understanding
her feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you would say, lady; your son hardly knows
as yet how much is asked of him, and the little maid, to whom he
vows his heart, is over-young to secure it.&nbsp; But, lady, I
have often observed that men, whose family affections are as deep
and fervent as your son&rsquo;s are for you and his brother,
seldom have wandering passions, but that their love flows deep
and steady in the channels prepared for it.&nbsp; Let your young
Freiherr regard this damsel as his own, and you will see he will
love her as such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust so, my liege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, if she turn out like the spiteful Trautbach
folk,&rdquo; said Maximilian, rather wickedly, &ldquo;plenty of
holes can be picked in a baby-wedding.&nbsp; No fear of its
over-firmness.&nbsp; I never saw one come to good; only he must
keep firm hold on the lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not easy to answer, coming from a prince who had no
small experience in premature bridals coming to nothing, and
Christina felt that the matter was taken out of her hands, and
that she had no more to do but to enjoy the warm-hearted
Kaisar&rsquo;s praises of her son.</p>
<p>In fact, the general run of nobles were then so boorish and
violent compared with the citizens, that a nobleman who possessed
intellect, loyalty, and conscience was so valuable to the
sovereign that Maximilian was rejoiced to do all that either
could bind him to his service or increase his power.&nbsp; The
true history of this expedition on the Emperor&rsquo;s part was
this&mdash;that he had consulted Kasimir upon the question of the
Debateable Ford and the feud of Adlerstein and Schlangenwald,
asking further how his friend had sped in the wooing of the fair
widow, to which he remembered having given his consent at
Ulm.</p>
<p>Wildschloss replied that, though backed up by her kindred at
Ulm, he had made no progress in consequence of the determined
opposition of her two sons, and he had therefore resolved to wait
a while, and let her and the young Baron feel their inability to
extricate themselves from the difficulties that were sure to
beset them, without his authority, influence, and
experience&mdash;fully believing that some predicament might
arise that would bring the mother to terms, if not the sons.</p>
<p>This disaster did seem to have fallen out, and he had meant at
once to offer himself to the lady as her supporter and advocate,
able to bring about all her son could desire; though he owned
that his hopes would have been higher if the survivor had been
the gentle, friendly Friedmund, rather than the hot and imperious
Eberhard, who he knew must be brought very low ere his objections
would be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The touch of romance had quite fascinated Maximilian.&nbsp; He
would see the lady and her son.&nbsp; He would make all things
easy by the personal influence that he so well knew how to exert,
backed by his imperial authority; and both should see cause to be
thankful to purchase consent to the bridge-building, and pardon
for the fray, by the marriage between the widow and Sir
Kasimir.</p>
<p>But the Last of the Knights was a gentleman, and the meek
dignity of his hostess had hindered him from pressing on her any
distasteful subject until her son&rsquo;s explanation of the
uncertainty of her husband&rsquo;s death had precluded all
mention of this intention.&nbsp; Besides, Maximilian was himself
greatly charmed by Ebbo&rsquo;s own qualities&mdash;partly
perhaps as an intelligent auditor, but also by his good sense,
high spirit, and, above all, by the ready and delicate tact that
had both penetrated and respected the disguise.&nbsp; Moreover,
Maximilian, though a faulty, was a devout man, and could
appreciate the youth&rsquo;s unswerving truth, under
circumstances that did, in effect, imperil him more really than
his guest.&nbsp; In this mood, Maximilian felt disposed to be rid
to the very utmost of poor Sir Kasimir&rsquo;s unlucky attachment
to a wedded lady; and receiving letters suggestive of the Eastern
mission, instantly decided that it would only be doing as he
would be done by instantly to order the disappointed suitor off
to the utmost parts of the earth, where he would much have liked
to go himself, save for the unlucky clog of all the realm of
Germany.&nbsp; That Sir Kasimir had any tie to home he had for
the moment entirely forgotten; and, had he remembered it, the
knight was so eminently fitted to fulfil his purpose, that it
could hardly have been regarded.&nbsp; But, when Wildschloss
himself devised his little heiress&rsquo;s union with the head of
the direct line, it was a most acceptable proposal to the
Emperor, who set himself to forward it at once, out of policy,
and as compensation to all parties.</p>
<p>And so Christina&rsquo;s gentle remonstrance was passed
by.&nbsp; Yet, with all her sense of the venture, it was
thankworthy to look back on the trembling anxiety with which she
had watched her boy&rsquo;s childhood, and all his temptations
and perils, and compare her fears with his present position: his
alliance courted, his wisdom honoured, the child of the proud,
contemned outlaw received as the favourite of the Emperor, and
the valued ally of her own honoured burgher world.&nbsp; Yet he
was still a mere lad.&nbsp; How would it be for the future?</p>
<p>Would he be unspoiled?&nbsp; Yes, even as she already viewed
one of her twins as the star on high&mdash;nay, when kneeling in
the chapel, her dazzling tears made stars of the glint of the
light reflected in his bright helmet&mdash;might she not trust
that the other would yet run his course to and fro, as the spark
in the stubble?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ALTAR OF PEACE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one could bear to waken the
young Baron till the sun had risen high enough to fall on his
face and unclose his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rdquo; (ever his first word), &ldquo;you have
let me sleep too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou didst wake too long, I fear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped you knew it not.&nbsp; Yes, my wound throbbed
sore, and the wonders of the day whirled round my brain like the
wild huntsman&rsquo;s chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, cruel boy, thou didst not call to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, with such a yesterday, and such a morrow for you?
while, chance what may, I can but lie still.&nbsp; I thought I
must call, if I were still so wretched, when the last moonbeam
faded; but, behold, sleep came, and therewith my Friedel sat by
me, and has sung songs of peace ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hath lulled thee to content, dear son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Content as the echo of his voice and the fulfilment of
his hope can make me,&rdquo; said Ebbo.</p>
<p>And so Christina made her son ready for the day&rsquo;s
solemnities, arraying him in a fine holland shirt with exquisite
broidery of her own on the collar and sleeves, and carefully
disposing his long glossy, dark brown hair so as to fall on his
shoulders as he lay propped up by cushions.&nbsp; She would have
thrown his crimson mantle round him, but he repelled it
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gay braveries for me, while my Friedel
is not yet in his resting-place?&nbsp; Here&mdash;the black
velvet cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Ebbo! it makes thee look more of a corpse than a
bridegroom.&nbsp; Thou wilt scare thy poor little spouse.&nbsp;
Ah! it was not thus I had fancied myself decking thee for thy
wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little one!&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;If, as
your uncle says, mourning is the seed of joy, this bridal should
prove a gladsome one!&nbsp; But let her prove a loving child to
you, and honour my Friedel&rsquo;s memory, then shall I love her
well.&nbsp; Do not fear, motherling; with the roots of hatred and
jealousy taken out of the heart, even sorrow is such peace that
it is almost joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was over early for pain and sorrow to have taught that
lesson, thought the mother, as with tender tears she gave place
to the priest, who was to begin the solemnities of the day by
shriving the young Baron.&nbsp; It was Father Norbert, who had in
this very chamber baptized the brothers, while their grandmother
was plotting the destruction of their godfather, even while he
gave Friedmund his name of peace,&mdash;Father Norbert, who had
from the very first encouraged the drooping, heart-stricken,
solitary Christina not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome
evil with good.</p>
<p>A temporary altar was erected between the windows, and hung
with the silk and embroidery belonging to that in the chapel: a
crucifix was placed on it, with the shrine of the stone of
Nic&aelig;a, one or two other relics brought on St.
Ruprecht&rsquo;s cloister, and a beautiful mother-of-pearl and
gold pyx also from the abbey, containing the host.&nbsp; These
were arranged by the chaplain, Father Norbert, and three of his
brethren from the abbey.&nbsp; And then the Father Abbot, a
kindly, dignified old man, who had long been on friendly terms
with the young Baron, entered; and after a few kind though
serious words to him, assumed a gorgeous cope stiff with gold
embroidery, and, standing by the altar, awaited the arrival of
the other assistants at the ceremony.</p>
<p>The slender, youthful-looking, pensive lady of the castle, in
her wonted mourning dress, was courteously handed to her
son&rsquo;s bedside by the Emperor.&nbsp; He was in his plain
buff leathern hunting garb, unornamented, save by the rich clasp
of his sword-belt and his gold chain, and his head was only
covered by the long silken locks of fair hair that hung round his
shoulders; but, now that his large keen dark blue eyes were
gravely restrained, and his eager face composed, his countenance
was so majestic, his bearing so lofty, that not all his crowns
could have better marked his dignity.</p>
<p>Behind him came a sunburnt, hardy man, wearing the white
mantle and black fleur-de-lis-pointed cross of the Teutonic
Order.&nbsp; A thrill passed through Ebbo&rsquo;s veins as he
beheld the man who to him represented the murderer of his brother
and both his grandfathers, the cruel oppressor of his father, and
the perpetrator of many a more remote, but equally unforgotten,
injury.&nbsp; And in like manner Sir Dankwart beheld the actual
slayer of his father, and the heir of a long score of deadly
retribution.&nbsp; No wonder then that, while the Emperor spoke a
few words of salutation and inquiry, gracious though not
familiar, the two foes scanned one another with a shiver of
mutual repulsing, and a sense that they would fain have fought it
out as in the good old times.</p>
<p>However, Ebbo only beheld a somewhat dull, heavy,
honest-looking visage of about thirty years old, good-nature
written in all its flat German features, and a sort of puzzled
wonder in the wide light eyes that stared fixedly at him, no
doubt in amazement that the mighty huge-limbed Wolfgang could
have been actually slain by the delicately-framed youth, now more
colourless than ever in consequence of the morning&rsquo;s
fast.&nbsp; Schleiermacher was also present, and the chief
followers on either hand had come into the lower part of the
room&mdash;Hatto, Heinz, and Koppel, looking far from contented;
some of the Emperor&rsquo;s suite; and a few attendants of
Schlangenwald, like himself connected with the Teutonic
Order.</p>
<p>The Emperor spoke: &ldquo;We have brought you together, Herr
Graff von Schlangenwald, and Herr Freiherr von Adlerstein,
because ye have given us reason to believe you willing to lay
aside the remembrance of the foul and deadly strifes of your
forefathers, and to live as good Christians in friendship and
brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, it is true,&rdquo; said Schlangenwald; and
&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; replied Maximilian.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nor can our reign better begin than by the closing of a
breach that has cost the land some of its bravest sons.&nbsp;
Dankwart von Schlangenwald, art thou willing to pardon the heir
of Adlerstein for having slain thy father in free and honourable
combat, as well as, doubtless, for other deeds of his ancestors,
more than I know or can specify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, truly; I pardon him, my liege, as befits my
vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou, Eberhard von Adlerstein, dost thou put from
thee vengeance for thy twin brother&rsquo;s death, and all the
other wrongs that thine house has suffered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put revenge from me for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye agree, further, then, instead of striving as to your
rights to the piece of meadow called the Debateable Strand, and
to the wrecks of burthens there cast up by the stream, ye will
unite with the citizens of Ulm in building a bridge over the
Braunwasser, where, your mutual portions thereof being decided by
the Swabian League, toll may be taken from all vehicles and
beasts passing there over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We agree,&rdquo; said both knights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, also, on behalf of the two guilds of Ulm,&rdquo;
added Moritz Schleiermacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likewise,&rdquo; continued the Emperor, &ldquo;for
avoidance of debate, and to consecrate the spot that has caused
so much contention, ye will jointly erect a church, where may be
buried both the relatives who fell in the late unhappy skirmish,
and where ye will endow a perpetual mass for their souls, and
those of others of your two races.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereto I willingly agree,&rdquo; said the Teutonic
knight.&nbsp; But to Ebbo it was a shock that the pure, gentle
Friedmund should thus be classed with his treacherous assassin;
and he had almost declared that it would be sacrilege, when he
received from the Emperor a look of stern, surprised command,
which reminded him that concession must not be all on one side,
and that he could not do Friedel a greater wrong than to make him
a cause of strife.&nbsp; So, though they half choked him, he
contrived to utter the words, &ldquo;I consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in token of amity I here tear up and burn all the
feuds of Adlerstein,&rdquo; said Schlangenwald, producing from
his pouch a collection of hostile literature, beginning from a
crumpled strip of yellow parchment and ending with a coarse paper
missive in the clerkly hand of burgher-bred Hugh Sorel, and
bearing the crooked signatures of the last two Eberhards of
Adlerstein&mdash;all with great seals of the eagle shield
appended to them.&nbsp; A similar collection&mdash;which, with
one or two other family defiances, and the letters of investiture
recently obtained at Ulm, formed the whole archives of
Adlerstein&mdash;had been prepared within Ebbo&rsquo;s reach; and
each of the two, taking up a dagger, made extensive gashes in
these documents, and then&mdash;with no mercy to the future
antiquaries, who would have gloated over them&mdash;the whole
were hurled into the flames on the hearth, where the odour they
emitted, if not grateful to the physical sense, should have been
highly agreeable to the moral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, holy Father Abbot,&rdquo; said Maximilian,
&ldquo;let us ratify this happy and Christian reconciliation by
the blessed sacrifice of peace, over which these two faithful
knights shall unite in swearing good-will and
brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such solemn reconciliations were frequent, but, alas were too
often a mockery.&nbsp; Here, however, both parties were men who
felt the awe of the promise made before the Pardon-winner of all
mankind.&nbsp; Ebbo, bred up by his mother in the true life of
the Church, and comparatively apart from practical superstitions,
felt the import to the depths of his inmost soul, with a force
heightened by his bodily state of nervous impressibility; and his
wan, wasted features and dark shining eyes had a strange
spiritual beam, &ldquo;half passion and half awe,&rdquo; as he
followed the words of universal forgiveness and lofty praise that
he had heard last in his anguished trance, when his brother lay
dying beside him, and leaving him behind.&nbsp; He knew now that
it was for this.</p>
<p>His deep repressed ardour and excitement were no small
contrast to the sober, matter-of-fact demeanour of the Teutonic
knight, who comported himself with the mechanical decorum of an
ecclesiastic, but quite as one who meant to keep his word.&nbsp;
Maximilian served the mass in his royal character as
sub-deacon.&nbsp; He was fond of so doing, either from humility,
or love of incongruity, or both.&nbsp; No one, however,
communicated except the clergy and the parties
concerned&mdash;Dankwart first, as being monk as well as knight,
then Eberhard and his mother; and then followed, interposed into
the rite, the oath of pardon, friendship, and brotherhood
administered by the abbot, and followed by the solemn kiss of
peace.&nbsp; There was now no recoil; Eberhard raised himself to
meet the lips of his foe, and his heart went with the
embrace.&nbsp; Nay, his inward ear dwelt on Friedmund&rsquo;s
song mingling with the concluding chants of praise.</p>
<p>The service ended, it was part of the pledge of amity that the
reconciled enemies should break their fast together, and a
collation of white bread and wine was provided for the
purpose.&nbsp; The Emperor tried to promote free and friendly
talk between the two adversaries, but not with great success; for
Dankwart, though honest and sincere, seemed extremely dull.&nbsp;
He appeared to have few ideas beyond his Prussian commandery and
its routine discipline, and to be lost in a castle where all was
at his sole will and disposal, and he caught eagerly at all
proposals made to him as if they were new lights.&nbsp; As, for
instance, that some impartial arbitrator should be demanded from
the Swabian League to define the boundary; and that next
Rogation-tide the two knights should ride or climb it in company,
while meantime the serfs should be strictly charged not to
trespass, and any transgressor should be immediately escorted to
his own lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; quoth Sir Dankwart, in a most serious tone,
&ldquo;I am told that a she-bear wons in a den on yonder crag,
between the pass you call the Gemsbock&rsquo;s and the
Schlangenwald valley.&nbsp; They told me the right in it had
never been decided, and I have not been up myself.&nbsp; To say
truth, I have lived so long in the sand plains as to have lost my
mountain legs, and I hesitated to see if a hunter could mount
thither for fear of fresh offence; but, if she bide there till
Rogation-tide, it will be ill for the lambs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; cried Maximilian.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
will I, a neutral, kill your bear for you, gentlemen, so that
neither need transgress this new crag of debate.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
go down and look at your bear spears, friend Ebbo, and be ready
so soon as Kasimir has done with his bridal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That crag!&rdquo; cried Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little good
will it do either of us.&nbsp; Sire, it is a mere wall of sloping
rock, slippery as ice, and with only a stone or matting of ivy
here and there to serve as foothold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where bear can go, man can go,&rdquo; replied the
Kaisar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; We have been there, craving your pardon,
Herr Graf,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;after a dead chamois that
rolled into a cleft, but it is the worst crag on all the hill,
and the frost will make it slippery.&nbsp; Sire, if you do
venture it, I conjure you to take Koppel, and climb by the rocks
from the left, not the right, which looks easiest.&nbsp; The
yellow rock, with a face like a man&rsquo;s, is the safer; but
ach, it is fearful for one who knows not the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know not the rocks, all true German rocks know
me,&rdquo; smiled Maximilian, to whom the danger seemed to be
such a stimulus that he began to propose the bear-hunt
immediately, as an interlude while waiting for the bride.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, half-a-dozen horsemen were seen
coming up from the ford, by the nearer path, and a forerunner
arrived with the tidings that the Baron of Adlerstein Wildschloss
was close behind with the little Baroness Thekla.</p>
<p>Half the moonlight night had Sir Kasimir and his escort
ridden; and, after a brief sleep at the nearest inn outside Ulm,
he had entered in early morning, demanded admittance at the
convent, made short work with the Abbess Ludmilla&rsquo;s
arguments, claimed his daughter, and placing her on a cushion
before him on his saddle, had borne her away, telling her of
freedom, of the kind lady, and the young knight who had dazzled
her childish fancy.</p>
<p>Christina went down to receive her.&nbsp; There was no time to
lose, for the huntsman Kaisar was bent on the slaughter of his
bear before dark, and, if he were to be witness of the wedding,
it must be immediate.&nbsp; He was in a state of much impatience,
which he beguiled by teasing his friend Wildschloss by reminding
him how often he himself had been betrothed, and had managed to
slip his neck out of the noose.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, if my Margot be
not soon back on my hands, I shall give the French credit,&rdquo;
he said, tossing his bear-spear in the air, and catching it
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, this bride is as long of busking her as
if she were a beauty of seventeen!&nbsp; I must be off to my Lady
Bearess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus nothing could be done to prepare the little maiden but to
divest her of her mufflings, and comb out her flaxen hair,
crowning it with a wreath which Christina had already woven from
the myrtle of her own girlhood, scarcely waiting to answer the
bewildered queries and entreaties save by caresses and
admonitions to her to be very good.</p>
<p>Poor little thing!&nbsp; She was tired, frightened, and
confused; and, when she had been brought upstairs, she answered
the half smiling, half shy greeting of her bridegroom with a
shudder of alarm, and the exclamation, &ldquo;Where is the
beautiful young knight?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a lady going to take
the veil lying under the pall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look rather like a little nun yourself,&rdquo; said
Ebbo, for she wore a little conventual dress, &ldquo;but we must
take each other for such as we are;&rdquo; and, as she hid her
face and clung to his mother, he added in a more cheerful,
coaxing tone, &ldquo;You once said you would be my
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but then there were two of you, and you were all
shining bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could be answered, the impatient Emperor returned,
and brought with him the abbot, who proceeded to find the place
in his book, and to ask the bridegroom for the rings.&nbsp; Ebbo
looked at Sir Kasimir, who owned that he should have brought them
from Ulm, but that he had forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jewels are not plenty with us,&rdquo; said Ebbo, with a
glow of amusement and confusion dawning on his cheek, such as
reassured the little maid that she beheld one of the two
beautiful young knights.&nbsp; &ldquo;Must we borrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina looked at the ring she had first seen lying on her
own Eberhard&rsquo;s palm, and felt as if to let it be used would
sever the renewed hope she scarcely yet durst entertain; and at
the same moment Maximilian glanced at his own fingers, and
muttered, &ldquo;None but this!&nbsp; Unlucky!&rdquo;&nbsp; For
it was the very diamond which Mary of Burgundy had sent to assure
him of her faith, and summon him to her aid after her
father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Sir Kasimir had not retained the
pledge of his own ill-omened wedlock; but, in the midst of the
dilemma, the Emperor, producing his dagger, began to detach some
of the massive gold links of the chain that supported his
hunting-horn.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the
little elf of a bride can get her finger into this lesser one and
you&mdash;verily this largest will fit, and the goldsmith can
beat it out when needed.&nbsp; So on with you in St.
Hubert&rsquo;s name, Father Abbot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slender-boned and thin as was Ebbo&rsquo;s hand, it was a very
tight fit, but the purpose was served.&nbsp; The service
commenced; and fortunately, thanks to Thekla&rsquo;s conventual
education, she was awed into silence and decorum by the sound of
Latin and the sight of an abbot.&nbsp; It was a strange marriage,
if only in the contrast between the pale, expressive face and
sad, dark eyes of the prostrate youth, and the frightened,
bewildered little girl, standing upon a stool to reach up to him,
with her blue eyes stretched with wonder, and her cheeks flushed
and pouting with unshed tears, her rosy plump hand enclosed in
the long white wasted one that was thus for ever united to it by
the broken fragments of Kaisar Max&rsquo;s chain.</p>
<p>The rite over, two attestations of the marriage of Eberhard,
Freiherr von Adlerstein, and Thekla, Freiherrinn von Adlerstein
Wildschloss and Felsenbach, were drawn up and signed by the
abbot, the Emperor, Count Dankwart, and the father and mother of
the two contracting parties; one to be committed to the care of
the abbot, the other to be preserved by the house of
Adlerstein.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor, as the concluding grace of the ceremonial,
bent to kiss the bride; but, tired, terrified, and cross, Thekla,
as if quite relieved to have some object for her resentment,
returned his attempt with a vehement buffet, struck with all the
force of her small arm, crying out, &ldquo;Go away with
you!&nbsp; I know I&rsquo;ve never married <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The better for my eyes!&rdquo; said the good-natured
Emperor, laughing heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lady Bearess is like
to prove the more courteous bride!&nbsp; Fare thee well, Sir
Bridegroom,&rdquo; he added, stooping over Ebbo, and kissing his
brow; &ldquo;Heaven give thee joy of this day&rsquo;s work, and
of thy faithful little fury.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send her the
bearskin as her meetest wedding-gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the next that was heard from the Kaisar was the arrival of
a parcel of Italian books for the Freiherr Eberhard, and for the
little Freiherrinn a large bundle, which proved to contain a
softly-dressed bearskin, with the head on, the eyes being made of
rubies, a gold muzzle and chain on the nose, and the claws tipped
with gold.&nbsp; The Emperor had made a point that it should be
conveyed to the castle, snow or no snow, for a yule gift.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OLD IRON AND NEW STEEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> clear sunshine of early summer
was becoming low on the hillsides.&nbsp; Sparkling and dimpling,
the clear amber-coloured stream of the Braunwasser rippled along
its stony bed, winding in and out among the rocks so humbly that
it seemed to be mocked by the wide span of the arch that crossed
it in all the might of massive bulwarks, and dignified masonry of
huge stones.</p>
<p>Some way above, a clearing of the wood below the mountain
showed huts, and labourers apparently constructing a mill so as
to take advantage of the leap of the water from the height above;
and, on the left bank, an enclosure was traced out, within which
were rising the walls of a small church, while the noise of the
mallet and chisel echoed back from the mountain side, and masons,
white with stone-dust, swarmed around.</p>
<p>Across the bridge came a pilgrim, marked out as such by hat,
wallet, and long staff, on which he leant heavily, stumbling
along as if both halting and footsore, and bending as one bowed
down by past toil and present fatigue.&nbsp; Pausing in the
centre, he gazed round with a strange disconcerted air&mdash;at
the castle on the terraced hillside, looking down with bright
eyes of glass glittering in the sunshine, and lighting up even
that grim old pile; at the banner hanging so lazily that the
tinctures and bearings were hidden in the folds; then at the
crags, rosy purple in evening glow, rising in broad step above
step up to the Red Eyrie, bathed in sunset majesty of dark
crimson; and above it the sweep of the descending eagle,
discernible for a moment in the pearly light of the sky.&nbsp;
The pilgrim&rsquo;s eye lighted up as he watched it; but then,
looking down at bridge, and church, and trodden wheel-tracked
path, he frowned with perplexity, and each painful step grew
heavier and more uncertain.</p>
<p>Near the opposite side of the enclosure there waited a tall,
rugged-looking, elderly man with two horses&mdash;one an aged
mare, mane, tail, and all of the snowiest silvery white; the
other a little shaggy dark mountain pony, with a
pad-saddle.&nbsp; And close to the bank of the stream might be
seen its owner, a little girl of some seven years, whose tight
round lace cap had slipped back, as well as her blue silk hood,
and exposed a profusion of loose flaxen hair, and a plump,
innocent face, intent upon some private little bit of building of
her own with some pebbles from the brook, and some mortar filched
from the operations above, to the great detriment of her soft
pinky fingers.</p>
<p>The pilgrim looked at her unperceived, and for a moment was
about to address her; but then, with a strange air of repulsion,
dragged himself on to the porch of the rising church, where,
seated on a block of stone, he could look into the
interior.&nbsp; All was unfinished, but the portion which had
made the most progress was a chantry-chapel opposite to the
porch, and containing what were evidently designed to be two
monuments.&nbsp; One was merely blocked out, but it showed the
outline of a warrior, bearing a shield on which a coiled serpent
was rudely sketched in red chalk.&nbsp; The other, in a much more
forward state, was actually under the hands of the sculptor, and
represented a slender youth, almost a boy, though in the full
armour of a knight, his hands clasped on his breast over a lute,
an eagle on his shield, an eagle-crest on his helmet, and, under
the arcade supporting the altar-tomb, shields alternately of
eagles and doves.</p>
<p>But the strangest thing was that this young knight seemed to
be sitting for his own effigy.&nbsp; The very same face, under
the very same helmet, only with the varied, warm hues of life,
instead of in cold white marble, was to be seen on the shoulders
of a young man in a gray cloth dress, with a black scarf passing
from shoulder to waist, crossed by a sword-belt.&nbsp; The hair
was hidden by the helmet, whose raised visor showed keen,
finely-cut features, and a pair of dark brown eyes, of somewhat
grave and sad expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care, Lucas,&rdquo; he presently said; &ldquo;I
fear me you are chiselling away too much.&nbsp; It must be a
softer, more rounded face than mine has become; and, above all,
let it not catch any saddened look.&nbsp; Keep that air of solemn
waiting in glad hope, as though he saw the dawn through his
closed eyelids, and were about to take up his song
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, Herr Freiherr, now the likeness is so far
forward, the actual sight of you may lead me to mar it rather
than mend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is it well that this should be the last
sitting.&nbsp; I am to set forth for Genoa in another week.&nbsp;
If I cannot get letters from the Kaisar, I shall go in search of
him, that he may see that my lameness is no more an
impediment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilgrim passed his hand over his face, as though to
dissipate a bewildering dream; and just then the little girl, all
flushed and dabbled, flew rushing up from the stream, but came to
a sudden standstill at sight of the stranger, who at length
addressed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little lady,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;is this the Debateable Ford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; now it is the Friendly Bridge,&rdquo; said the
child.</p>
<p>The pilgrim started, as with a pang of recollection.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what is yonder castle?&rdquo; he further asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schloss Adlerstein,&rdquo; she said, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are the little lady of Adlerstein
Wildschloss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; again she answered; and then, gathering
courage&mdash;&ldquo;You are a holy pilgrim!&nbsp; Come up to the
castle for supper and rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, springing past
him, she flew up to the knight, crying, &ldquo;Herr Freiherr,
here is a holy pilgrim, weary and hungry.&nbsp; Let us take him
home to the mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he take thee for a wild elf?&rdquo; said the young
man, with an elder-brotherly endeavour to right the little cap
that had slidden under the chin, and to push back the
unmanageable wealth of hair under it, ere he rose; and he came
forward and spoke with kind courtesy, as he observed the
wanderer&rsquo;s worn air and feeble step.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dost need
a night&rsquo;s lodging, holy palmer?&nbsp; My mother will make
thee welcome, if thou canst climb as high as the castle
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilgrim made an obeisance, but, instead of answering,
demanded hastily, &ldquo;See I yonder the bearing of
Schlangenwald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so.&nbsp; Schloss Schlangenwald is about a league
further on, and thou wilt find a kind reception there, if thither
thou art bent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Graff Wolfgang&rsquo;s tomb?&rdquo; still
eagerly pursued the pilgrim; and receiving a sign in the
affirmative, &ldquo;What was his end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fell in a skirmish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whose hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; and the pilgrim surveyed him with
undisguised astonishment; then, without another word, took up his
staff and limped out of the building, but not on the road to
Schlangenwald.&nbsp; It was nearly a quarter of an hour
afterwards that he was overtaken by the young knight and the
little lady on their horses, just where the new road to the
castle parted from the old way by the Eagle&rsquo;s Ladder.&nbsp;
The knight reined up as he saw the poor man&rsquo;s slow, painful
steps, and said, &ldquo;So thou art not bound for
Schlangenwald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would to the village, so please you&mdash;to the
shrine of the Blessed Friedmund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, at this rate thou wilt not be there till
midnight,&rdquo; said the young knight, springing off his horse;
&ldquo;thou canst never brook our sharp stones!&nbsp; See,
Thekla, do thou ride on with Heinz to tell the mother I am
bringing her a holy pilgrim to tend.&nbsp; And thou, good man,
mount my old gray.&nbsp; Fear not; she is steady and sure-footed,
and hath of late been used to a lame rider.&nbsp; Ah! that is
well.&nbsp; Thou hast been in the saddle before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To go afoot for the sake of giving a lift to a holy wayfarer
was one of the most esteemed acts of piety of the Middle Age, so
that no one durst object to it, and the palmer did no more than
utter a suppressed murmur of acknowledgment as he seated himself
on horseback, the young knight walking by his rein.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But what is this?&rdquo; he exclaimed, almost with
dismay.&nbsp; &ldquo;A road to the castle up here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we find it a great convenience.&nbsp; Thou art
surely from these parts?&rdquo; added the knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a man-at-arms in the service of the Baron,&rdquo;
was the answer, in an odd, muffled tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&mdash;of my grandfather!&rdquo; was the
exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of old Freiherr
Eberhard.&nbsp; Not of any of the Wildschloss crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not a Wildschloss!&nbsp; I am grandson to
Freiherr Eberhard!&nbsp; Oh, wast thou with him and my father
when they were set upon in the hostel?&rdquo; he cried, looking
eagerly up to the pilgrim; but the man kept his broad-leaved hat
slouched over his face, and only muttered, &ldquo;The son of
Christina!&rdquo; the last word so low that Ebbo was not sure
that he caught it, and the next moment the old warrior exclaimed
exultingly, &ldquo;And you have had vengeance on them!&nbsp;
When&mdash;how&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last harvest-tide&mdash;at the Debateable
Strand,&rdquo; said Ebbo, never able to speak of the encounter
without a weight at his heart, but drawn on by the earnestness of
the old foe of Schlangenwald.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a meeting in
full career&mdash;lances broken, sword-stroke on either
hand.&nbsp; I was sore wounded, but my sword went through his
collar-bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well struck! good stroke!&rdquo; cried the pilgrim, in
rapture.&nbsp; &ldquo;And with that sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this sword.&nbsp; Didst know it?&rdquo; said Ebbo,
drawing the weapon, and giving it to the old man, who held it for
a few moments, weighed it affectionately, and with a long low
sigh restored it, saying, &ldquo;It is well.&nbsp; You and that
blade have paid off the score.&nbsp; I should be content.&nbsp;
Let me dismount.&nbsp; I know my way to the hermitage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, what is this?&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;thou must
have rest and food.&nbsp; The hermitage is empty, scarce
habitable.&nbsp; My mother will not be balked of the care of thy
bleeding feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me go, ere I bring evil on you all.&nbsp; I can
pray up there, and save my soul, but I cannot see it
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; said Ebbo, again trying to see his
guest&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;There may be changes, but an old
faithful follower of my father&rsquo;s must ever be
welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when his wife has taken a new lord,&rdquo; growled
the stranger, bitterly, &ldquo;and he a Wildschloss!&nbsp; Young
man, I could have pardoned aught else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not who you may be who talk of pardoning my
lady-mother,&rdquo; said Ebbo, &ldquo;but new lord she has
neither taken nor will take.&nbsp; She has refused every offer;
and, now that Schlangenwald with his last breath confessed that
he slew not my father, but sold him to the Turks, I have been
only awaiting recovery from my wound to go in search of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then is yonder child, who told me she was
Wildschloss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child,&rdquo; said Ebbo, with half a smile and
half a blush, &ldquo;is my wife, the daughter of Wildschloss, who
prayed me to espouse her thus early, that so my mother might
bring her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the castle court, now a
well-kept, lordly-looking enclosure, where the pilgrim looked
about him as one bewildered.&nbsp; He was so infirm that Ebbo
carefully helped him up the stone stairs to the hall, where he
already saw his mother prepared for the hospitable reception of
the palmer.&nbsp; Leaving him at the entrance, Ebbo crossed the
hall to say to her in a low voice, &ldquo;This pilgrim is one of
the old lanzknechts of my grandfather&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; I
wonder whether you or Heinz will know him.&nbsp; One of the old
sort&mdash;supremely discontented at change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou hast walked up, and wearied thyself!&rdquo;
exclaimed Christina, grieved to see her son&rsquo;s halting
step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rest will soon cure that,&rdquo; said Ebbo, seating
himself as he spoke on a settle near the hall fire; but the next
moment a strange wild low shriek from his mother made him start
up and spring to her side.&nbsp; She stood with hands clasped,
and wondering eyes.&nbsp; The pilgrim&mdash;his hat on the
ground, his white head and rugged face displayed&mdash;was gazing
as though devouring her with his eyes, murmuring,
&ldquo;Unchanged! unchanged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this!&rdquo; thundered the young Baron.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are you doing to the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush, Ebbo!&rdquo; exclaimed Christina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is thy father!&nbsp; On thy knees!&nbsp; Thy father is
come!&nbsp; It is our son, my own lord.&nbsp; Oh, embrace
him!&nbsp; Kneel to him, Ebbo!&rdquo; she wildly cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, mother,&rdquo; said Ebbo, keeping his arm round
her, though she struggled against him, for he felt some doubts as
he looked back at his walk with the stranger, and remembered
Heinz&rsquo;s want of recognition.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it certain
that this is indeed my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ebbo,&rdquo; was the cry of poor Christina, almost
beside herself, &ldquo;how could I not be sure?&nbsp; I know
him!&nbsp; I feel it!&nbsp; Oh, my lord, bear with him.&nbsp; It
is his wont to be so loving!&nbsp; Ebbo, cannot you see it is
himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young fellow is right,&rdquo; said the stranger,
slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will answer all he may demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said Ebbo, abashed, &ldquo;forgive
me;&rdquo; and, as his mother broke from him, he fell upon his
knee; but he only heard his father&rsquo;s cry, &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp;
Stine, Stine, thou alone art the same,&rdquo; and, looking up,
saw her, with her face hidden in the white beard, quivering with
a rapture such as he had never seen in her before.&nbsp; It
seemed long to him ere she looked up again in her husband&rsquo;s
face to sob on: &ldquo;My son!&nbsp; Oh! my beautiful
twins!&nbsp; Our son!&nbsp; Oh, see him, dear lord!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the pilgrim turned to hear Ebbo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pardon,
honoured father, and your blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost bashfully the pilgrim laid his hand on the dark head,
and murmured something; then said, &ldquo;Up, then!&nbsp; The
slayer of Schlangenwald kneeling!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Stine, I knew
thy little head was wondrous wise, but I little thought thou
wouldst breed him up to avenge us on old Wolfgang!&nbsp; So
slender a lad too!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Schneiderlein, old rogue, I
knew thee,&rdquo; holding out his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;So thou
didst get home safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, my lord; though, if I left you alive, never more
will I call a man dead,&rdquo; said Heinz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse luck for me&mdash;till now,&rdquo; said Sir
Eberhard, whose tones, rather than his looks, carried perfect
conviction of his identity.&nbsp; It was the old homely accent,
and gruff good-humoured voice, but with something subdued and
broken in the tone.&nbsp; His features had grown like his
father&rsquo;s, but he looked much older than ever the hale old
mountaineer had done, or than his real age; so worn and lined was
his face, his skin tanned, his eyelids and temples puckered by
burning sun, his hair and beard white as the inane of his old
mare, the proud Adlerstein port entirely gone.&nbsp; He stooped
even more without his staff than with it; and, when he yielded
himself with a sigh of repose to his wife&rsquo;s tendance, she
found that he had not merely the ordinary hurts of travelling,
but that there were old festering scars on his ankles.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The gyves,&rdquo; he said, as she looked up at him, with
startled, pitying eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little deemed I that they
would ever come under thy tender hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he almost
timidly smoothed the braid of dark hair on her
brow&mdash;&ldquo;So they never burnt thee for a witch after all,
little one?&nbsp; I thought my mother would never keep her hands
off thee, and used to fancy I heard the crackling of the
flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She spared me for my children&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said
Christina; &ldquo;and truly Heaven has been very good to us, but
never so much as now.&nbsp; My dear lord, will it weary thee too
much to come to the castle chapel and give thanks?&rdquo; she
said, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; he answered, earnestly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would go even on my knees.&nbsp; We were not without
masses even in Tunis; but, when Italian and Spaniard would be
ransomed, and there was no mind of the German, I little thought I
should ever sing Brother Lambert&rsquo;s psalm about turning our
captivity as rivers in the south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ebbo was hovering round, supplying all that was needed for his
father&rsquo;s comfort; but his parents were so completely
absorbed in one another that he was scarcely noticed, and, what
perhaps pained him more, there was no word about Friedel.&nbsp;
He felt this almost an injustice to the brother who had been
foremost in embracing the idea of the unknown father, and
scarcely understood how his parents shrank from any sorrowful
thought that might break in on their new-found joy, nor that he
himself was so strange and new a being in his father&rsquo;s
eyes, that to imagine him doubled was hardly possible to the
tardy, dulled capacity, which as yet seemed unable to feel
anything but that here was home, and Christina.</p>
<p>When the chapel bell rang, and the pair rose to offer their
thanksgiving, Ebbo dutifully offered his support, but was
absolutely unseen, so fondly was Sir Eberhard leaning on his
wife; and her bright exulting smile and shake of the head gave an
absolute pang to the son who had hitherto been all in all to
her.</p>
<p>He followed, and, as they passed Friedmund&rsquo;s coffin, he
thought his mother pointed to it, but even of this he was
uncertain.&nbsp; The pair knelt side by side with hands locked
together, while notes of praise rose from all voices; and
meantime Ebbo, close to that coffin, strove to share the joy, and
to lift up a heart that <i>would</i> sink in the midst of
self-reproach for undutifulness, and would dislike the thought of
the rude untaught man, holding aloof from him, likely to view him
with distrust and jealousy, and to undo all he had achieved, and
further absorbing the mother, the mother who was to him all the
world, and for whose sake he had given his best years to the
child-wife, as yet nothing to him.</p>
<p>It was reversing the natural order of things that, after
reigning from infancy, he should have to give up at eighteen to
one of the last generation; and some such thought rankled in his
mind when the whole household trooped joyfully out of the chapel
to prepare a banquet for their old new lord, and their young old
lord was left alone.</p>
<p>Alone with the coffin where the armour lay upon the white
cross, Ebbo threw himself on his knees, and laid his head upon
it, murmuring, &ldquo;Ah, Friedel!&nbsp; Friedel!&nbsp; Would
that we had changed places!&nbsp; Thou wouldst brook it
better.&nbsp; At least thou didst never know what it is to be
lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Baron!&rdquo; said a little voice.</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>His
first movement was impatient.&nbsp; Thekla was apt to pursue him
wherever he did not want her; but here he had least expected her,
for she had a great fear of that coffin, and could hardly be
brought to the chapel at prayer times, when she generally
occupied herself with fancies that the empty helmet glared at
her.&nbsp; But now Ebbo saw her standing as near as she durst,
with a sweet wistfulness in her eyes, such as he had never seen
there before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Thekla?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art
sent to call me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only I saw that you stayed here all alone,&rdquo;
she said, clasping her hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I not be alone, child?&rdquo; he said,
bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here lies my brother.&nbsp; My mother has
her husband again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have me!&rdquo; cried Thekla; and, as he looked
up between amusement and melancholy, he met such a loving eager
little face, that he could not help holding out his arms, and
letting her cling to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be afraid of the helmet again, if only
you will not lay down your head there, and say you are
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Thekla! while you are my little wife,&rdquo;
said he; and, child as she was, there was strange solace to his
heart in the eyes that, once vacant and wondering, had now gained
a look of love and intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she said, shuddering a
little, as he rose and laid his hand on Friedel&rsquo;s
sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make thee gird on thine own knight&rsquo;s
sword,&rdquo; said Ebbo, unbuckling that which he had so long
worn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friedel,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;thou wouldst
give me thine.&nbsp; Let me take up thy temper with it, thine
open-hearted love and humility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He guided Thekla&rsquo;s happy little fingers to the fastening
of the belt, and then, laying his hand on hers, said gravely,
&ldquo;Thekla, never speak of what I said just now&mdash;not even
to the mother.&nbsp; Remember, it is thy husband&rsquo;s first
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And feeling no longer solitary when his hand was in the clasp
of hers, he returned to the hall, where his father was installed
in the baronial chair, in which Ebbo had been at home from
babyhood.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s exclamation showed that her
son had been wanting to her; and she looked fuller than ever of
bliss when Ebbo gravely stood before his father, and presented
him with the good old sword that he had sent to his unborn
son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are like to use it more than I,&mdash;nay, you have
used it to some purpose,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet must I
keep mine old comrade at least a little while.&nbsp; Wife, son,
sword, should make one feel the same man again, but it is all too
wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that evening, and long after, his hand from time to time
sought the hilt of his sword, as if that touch above all proved
to him that he was again a free noble in his own castle.</p>
<p>The story he told was thus.&nbsp; The swoon in which Heinz had
left him had probably saved his life by checking the gush of
blood, and he had known no more till he found himself in a rough
cart among the corpses.&nbsp; At Schlangenwald&rsquo;s castle he
had been found still breathing, and had been flung into a
dungeon, where he lay unattended, for how long he never knew,
since all the early part of the time was lost in the clouds of
fever.&nbsp; On coarse fare and scanty drink, in that dark vault,
he had struggled by sheer obstinacy of vitality into
recovery.&nbsp; In the very height of midsummer alone did the sun
peep through the grating of his cell, and he had newly hailed
this cheerful visitor when he was roughly summoned, placed on
horseback with eyes and hands bound, and only allowed sight again
to find himself among a herd of his fellow Germans in the Turkish
camp.&nbsp; They were the prisoners of the terrible Turkish raid
of 1475, when Georg von Schenk and fourteen other noblemen of
Austria and Styria were all taken in one unhappy fight, and
dragged away into captivity, with hundreds of lower rank.</p>
<p>To Sir Eberhard the change had been greatly for the
better.&nbsp; The Turk had treated him much better than the
Christian; and walking in the open air, chained to a German
comrade, was far pleasanter than pining in his lonely
dungeon.&nbsp; At Adrianople, an offer had been made to each of
the captives, if they would become Moslems, of entering the
Ottoman service as Spahis; but with one voice they had refused,
and had then been draughted into different divisions.&nbsp; The
fifteen nobles, who had been offered for ransom, were taken to
Constantinople, to await its arrival, and they had promised Sir
Eberhard to publish his fate on their return to their homes; and,
though he knew the family resources too well to have many hopes,
he was rather hurt to find that their promise had been
unfulfilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! they had no opportunity,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gulden were scarce, or were all in Kaisar
Friedrich&rsquo;s great chest; the ransoms could not be raised,
and all died in captivity.&nbsp; I heard about it when I was at
Wurms last month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy at Wurms?&rdquo; almost gasped Sir Eberhard in
amaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to be there about matters concerning the
Wildschloss lands and the bridge,&rdquo; said Ebbo; &ldquo;and
both Dankwart von Schlangenwald and I made special inquiries
about that company in case you should have shared their
fate.&nbsp; I hoped to have set forth at that time, but the
Kaisar said I was still too lame, and refused me license, or
letters to the Sultan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not have found me,&rdquo; said his father,
narrating how he with a large troop of captives had been driven
down to the coast; where they were transferred to a Moorish
slave-dealer, who shipped them off for Tunis.&nbsp; Here, after
their first taste of the miseries of a sea life, the alternative
of Islam or slavery was again put before them.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,
by the holy stone of Nic&aelig;a,&rdquo; said Sir Eberhard,
&ldquo;I thought by that time that the infidels had the advantage
of us in good-will and friendliness; but, when they told me women
had no souls at all, no more than a horse or dog, I knew it was
but an empty dream of a religion; for did I not know that my
little Ermentrude, and thou, Stine, had finer, clearer, wiser
souls than ever a man I had known?&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, nay,&rsquo;
quoth I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll cast in my lot where I may meet my
wife hereafter, should I never see her here.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
He had then been allotted to a corsair, and had thenceforth been
chained to the bench of rowers, between the two decks, where, in
stifling heat and stench, in storm or calm, healthy or diseased,
the wretched oarsmen were compelled to play the part of machinery
in propelling the vessel, in order to capture Christian
ships&mdash;making exertions to which only the perpetual lash of
the galley-master could have urged their exhausted frames; often
not desisting for twenty or thirty hours, and rowing still while
sustenance was put into their mouths by their drivers.&nbsp; Many
a man drew has last breath with his last stroke, and was at the
first leisure moment hurled into the waves.&nbsp; It was the
description that had so deeply moved Friedel long ago, and
Christina wept over it, as she looked at the bowed form once so
proud and free, and thought of the unhealed scars.&nbsp; But
there, her husband added, he had been chained next to a holy
friar of German blood, like himself a captive of the great
Styrian raid; and, while some blasphemed in their misery, or
wildly chid their patron saints, this good man strove to show
that all was to work out good; he had a pious saying for all that
befell, and adored the will of God in thus purifying him;
&ldquo;And, if it were thus with a saint like him, I thought,
what must it be with a rough freebooting godless sinner such as I
had been?&nbsp; See&rdquo;&mdash;and he took out a rosary of
strung bladders of seaweed; &ldquo;that is what he left me when
he died, and what I meant to have been telling for ever up in the
hermitage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;he died on the shore of Corsica, while most of
the dogs were off harrying a village inland, and we had a sort of
respite, or I trow he would have rowed till his last gasp.&nbsp;
How he prayed for the poor wretches they were gone to
attack!&mdash;ay, and for all of us&mdash;for me
also&mdash;There&rsquo;s enough of it.&nbsp; Such talk skills not
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was plain that Sir Eberhard had learnt more Christianity in
the hold of his Moorish pirate ship than ever in the Holy Roman
Empire, and a weight was lifted off his son&rsquo;s mind by
finding that he had vowed never to return to a life of violence,
even though fancying a life of penance in a hermitage the only
alternative.</p>
<p>Ebbo asked if the Genoese merchant, Ser Gian Battista dei
Battiste, had indeed been one of his fellow-captives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&mdash;what?&rdquo; and on the repetition,
&ldquo;Truly I knew him, Merchant Gian as we used to call him;
but you twang off his name as they speak it in his own stately
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christina smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ebbo learnt the Italian tongue
this winter from our chaplain, who had studied at Bologna.&nbsp;
He was told it would aid in his quest of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me not!&rdquo; said the traveller, holding up his
hands in deprecation; &ldquo;the Junker is worse than a
priest!&nbsp; And yet he killed old Wolfgang!&nbsp; But what of
Gian?&nbsp; Hold,&mdash;did not he, when I was with him at Genoa,
tell me a story of being put into a dungeon in a mountain
fortress in Germany, and released by a pair of young lads with
eyes beaming in the sunrise, who vanished just as they brought
him to a cloister?&nbsp; Nay, he deemed it a miracle of the
saints, and hung up a votive picture thereof at the shrine of the
holy Cosmo and Damian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not so far wrong in deeming <i>one</i> of the
lads near of kin to the holy ones,&rdquo; said Christina,
softly.</p>
<p>And Ebbo briefly narrated the adventure, when it evidently
appeared that his having led at least one foray gave his father
for the first time a fellow-feeling for him, and a sense that he
was one of the true old stock; but, when he heard of the release,
he growled, &ldquo;So!&nbsp; How would a lad have fared who so
acted in my time?&nbsp; My poor old mother!&nbsp; She must have
been changed indeed not to have scourged him till he had no
strength to cry out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was my prisoner!&rdquo; said Ebbo, in his old
defiant tone; &ldquo;I had the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well! the Junker has always been master here, and I
never!&rdquo; said the elder knight, looking round rather
piteously; and Ebbo, with a sudden movement, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Nay, sir, you are the only lord and master, and I stand
ready to be the first to obey you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&nbsp; A fine young book-learned scholar, already
knighted, and with all these Wildschloss lands too!&rdquo; said
Sir Eberhard, gazing with a strange puzzled look at the delicate
but spirited features of this strange perplexing son.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Reach hither your hand, boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he compared the slender, shapely hand of such
finely-textured skin with the breadth of his own horny
giant&rsquo;s paw, he tossed it from him, shaking his head with a
gesture as if he had no commands for such feminine-looking
fingers to execute, and mortifying Ebbo not a little.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Christina, apologetically, &ldquo;it
always grieved your mother that the boys would resemble me and
mine.&nbsp; But, when daylight comes, Ebbo will show you that he
has not lost the old German strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt&mdash;no doubt,&rdquo; said Sir Eberhard,
hastily, &ldquo;since he has slain Schlangenwald; and, if the
former state of things be at an end, the less he takes after the
ancient stock the better.&nbsp; But I am an old man now, Stine,
though thou look&rsquo;st fair and fresh as ever, and I do not
know what to make of these things.&nbsp; White napery on the
table; glass drinking things;&mdash;nay, were it not for thee and
the Schneiderlein, I should not know I was at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was led back to his narration, and it appeared that, after
some years spent at the oar, certain bleedings from the lungs,
the remains of his wound, had become so much more severe as to
render him useless for naval purposes; and, as he escaped
actually dying during a voyage, he was allowed to lie by on
coming into port till he had in some degree recovered, and then
had been set to labour at the fortifications, chained to another
prisoner, and toiling between the burning sand and burning sun,
but treated with less horrible severity than the necessities of
the sea had occasioned on board ship, and experiencing the
benefit of intercourse with the better class of captives, whom
their miserable fate had thrown into the hands of the Moors.</p>
<p>It was a favourite almsdeed among the Proven&ccedil;als,
Spaniards, and Italians to send money for the redemption of
prisoners to the Moors, and there was a regular agency for
ransoms through the Jews; but German captives were such an
exception that no one thought of them, and many a time had the
summons come for such and such a slave by name, or for five poor
Sicilians, twenty Genoese, a dozen Marseillais, or the like, but
still no word for the Swabian; till he had made up his mind that
he should either leave his bones in the hot mud of the harbour,
or be only set free by some gallant descent either of the brave
King of Portugal, or of the Knights of Rhodes, of whom the
captives were ever dreaming and whispering.</p>
<p>At length his own slave name was shouted; he was called up by
the captain of his gang, and, while expecting some fresh
punishment, or, maybe, to find himself sold into some domestic
form of slavery, he was set before a Jewish agent, who, after
examining him on his name, country, and station, and comparing
his answers with a paper of instructions, informed him that he
was ransomed, caused his fetters to be struck off, and shipped
him off at once for Genoa, with orders to the captain to consign
him to the merchant Signor del Battiste.&nbsp; By him Sir
Eberhard had been received with the warmest hospitality, and
treated as befitted his original station, but Battista disclaimed
the merit of having ransomed him.&nbsp; He had but acted, he
said, as the agent of an Austrian gentleman, from whom he had
received orders to inquire after the Swabian baron who had been
his fellow-captive, and, if he were still living, to pay his
ransom, and bring him home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name&mdash;the name!&rdquo; eagerly asked Ebbo and
his mother at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name?&nbsp; Gian was wont to make bad work of our
honest German names, but I tried to learn this&mdash;being so
beholden to him.&nbsp; I even caused it to be spelt over to me,
but my letters long ago went from me.&nbsp; It seems to me that
the man is a knight-errant, like those of thy ballads,
Stine&mdash;one Ritter Theur&mdash;Theur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theurdank!&rdquo; cried Ebbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Theurdank.&nbsp; What, you know him?&nbsp; There is
nothing you and your mother don&rsquo;t know, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know him!&nbsp; Father, he is our greatest and
noblest!&nbsp; He has been kind to me beyond description.&nbsp;
He is the Kaisar!&nbsp; Now I see why he had that strange arch
look which so vexed me when he forbade me on my allegiance to set
forth till my lameness should be gone!&nbsp; Long ago had he
asked me all about Gian Battista.&nbsp; To him he must have
written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kaisar!&rdquo; said Sir Eberhard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,
the poor fellows I left in Turkey ever said he was too close of
fist for them to have hope from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that was old Kaisar Friedrich.&nbsp; This is our
own gallant Maximilian&mdash;a knight as true and brave as ever
was paladin,&rdquo; said Christina; &ldquo;and most truly loving
and prizing our Ebbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I wish&mdash;I wish,&rdquo; said Ebbo,
&ldquo;that he had let me win my father&rsquo;s liberty for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, well,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;there spoke
the Adlerstein.&nbsp; We never were wont to be beholden to king
or kaisar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; say Ebbo, after a moment&rsquo;s
recollection, colouring as he spoke; &ldquo;it is true that I
deserved it not.&nbsp; Nay, Sir Father, it is well.&nbsp; You owe
your freedom in very truth to the son you have not known.&nbsp;
It was he who treasured up the thought of the captive German
described by the merchant, and even dreamt of it, while never
doubting of your death; it was he who caught up
Schlangenwald&rsquo;s first hint that you lived, while I, in my
pride, passed it by as merely meant to perplex me; it was he who
had formed an absolute purpose of obtaining some certainty; and
at last, when my impetuosity had brought on the fatal battle, it
was he who bought with his own life the avowal of your
captivity.&nbsp; I had hoped to have fulfilled Friedel&rsquo;s
trust, and to have redeemed my own backwardness; but it is not to
be.&nbsp; While I was yet lying helpless on my bed, the Emperor
has taken it out of my power.&nbsp; Mother, you receive him from
Friedel&rsquo;s hands, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And well am I thankful that so it should be,&rdquo;
said Christina.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, Ebbo! sorely should I have pined
with anxiety when thou wast gone.&nbsp; And thy father knows that
thou hadst the full purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I know it,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;and,
after all, small blame to him even if he had not.&nbsp; He never
saw me, and light grieves the heart for what the eye hath not
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added the wife, &ldquo;since the Romish
king freed you, dear lord, cared he not better for your journey
than to let you come in this forlorn plight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, it appeared, was far from being his deliverer&rsquo;s
fault.&nbsp; Money had been supplied, and Sir Eberhard had
travelled as far as Aosta with a party of Italian merchants; but
no sooner had he parted with them than he was completely
astray.&nbsp; His whole experience of life had been as a robber
baron or as a slave, and he knew not how to take care of himself
as a peaceful traveller; he suffered fresh extortions at every
stage, and after a few days was plundered by his guides, beaten,
and left devoid of all means of continuing the journey to which
he could hardly hope for a cheerful end.&nbsp; He did not expect
to find his mother living,&mdash;far less that his unowned wife
could have survived the perils in which he had involved her; and
he believed that his ancestral home would, if not a ruin, be held
by his foes, or at best by the rival branch of the family, whose
welcome of the outlawed heir would probably be to a dungeon, if
not a halter.&nbsp; Yet the only magnet on earth for the lonely
wanderer was his native mountain, where from some old peasant he
might learn how his fair young bride had perished, and perhaps
the sins of his youth might be expiated by continual prayer in
the hermitage chapel where his sister lay buried, and whence he
could see the crags for which his eye and heart had craved so
long with the home-sickness of a mountaineer.</p>
<p>And now, when his own Christina had welcomed him with all the
overflow of her loving heart, unchanged save that hers had become
a tenderer yet more dignified loveliness; when his gallant son,
in all the bloom of young manhood, received him with dutiful
submission; when the castle, in a state of defence, prosperity,
and comfort of which he had never dreamt, was again his
own;&mdash;still the old man was bewildered, and sometimes
oppressed almost to distress.&nbsp; He had, as it were, fallen
asleep in one age of the world, and wakened in another, and it
seemed as if he really wished to defer his wakening, or else that
repose was an absolute novelty to him; for he sat dozing in his
chair in the sun the whole of the next day, and scarcely
spoke.</p>
<p>Ebbo, who felt it a necessity to come to an understanding of
the terms on which they were to stand, tried to refer matters to
him, and to explain the past, but he was met sometimes by a shake
of the head, sometimes by a nod&mdash;not of assent, but of
sleep; and his mother advised him not to harass the wearied
traveller, but to leave him to himself at least for that day, and
let him take his own time for exertion, letting things meantime
go on as usual.&nbsp; Ebbo obeyed, but with a load at his heart,
as he felt that all he was doing was but provisional, and that it
would be his duty to resign all that he had planned, and partly
executed, to this incompetent, ignorant rule.&nbsp; He could
certainly, when not serving the Emperor, go and act for himself
at Thekla&rsquo;s dower castle of Felsenbach, and his mother
might save things from going to utter ruin at Adlerstein; but no
reflection or self-reproach could make it otherwise than a bitter
pill to any Telemachus to have to resign to one so unlike Ulysses
in all but the length of his wanderings,&mdash;one, also, who
seemed only half to like, and not at all to comprehend, his
Telemachus.</p>
<p>Meantime Ebbo attended to such matters as were sure to come
each day before the Herr Freiherr.&nbsp; Now it was a question
whether the stone for the mill should be quarried where it would
undermine a bit of grass land, or further on, where the road was
rougher; now Berend&rsquo;s swine had got into Barthel&rsquo;s
rye, and Barthel had severely hurt one of them&mdash;the Herr
Freiherr&rsquo;s interference could alone prevent a hopeless
quarrel; now a waggon with ironwork for the mill claimed
exemption from toll as being for the Baron: and he must send down
the toll, to obviate injustice towards Schlangenwald and
Ulm.&nbsp; Old Ulrich&rsquo;s grandson, who had run away for a
lanzknecht, had sent a letter home (written by a comrade), the
Baron must read and answer it.&nbsp; Steinmark&rsquo;s son wanted
to be a poor student: the Herr Freiherr must write him a letter
of recommendation.&nbsp; Mother Grethel&rsquo;s ewe had fallen
into a cleft; her son came to borrow a rope, and ask aid, and the
Baron must superintend the hoisting the poor beast up
again.&nbsp; Hans had found the track of a wolf, and knew the
hole where a litter of cubs abode; the Freiherr, his wolf-hound,
and his spear were wanted for their destruction.&nbsp; Dietrich
could not tell how to manage his new arquebus: the Baron must
teach him to take aim.&nbsp; Then there was a letter from Ulm to
invite the Baron to consult on the tax demanded by the Emperor
for his Italian war, and how far it should concern the profits of
the bridge; and another letter from the Markgraf of Wurtemburg,
as chief of the Swabian League, requesting the Lord of Adlerstein
to be on the look-out for a band of robbers, who were reported to
be in neighbouring hills, after being hunted out of some of their
other lurking-places.</p>
<p>That very night, or rather nearly at the dawn of a summer
morning, there was a yelling below the castle, and a flashing of
torches, and tidings rang through it that a boor on the outskirts
of the mountain had had his ricks fired and his cattle driven by
the robbers, and his young daughters carried off.&nbsp; Old Sir
Eberhard hobbled down to the hall in time to see weapons flashing
as they were dealt out, to hear a clear decided voice giving
orders, to listen to the tramp of horse, and watch more reitern
pass out under the gateway than ever the castle had counted in
his father&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Then he went back to his bed, and
when he came down in the morning, found all the womankind of the
castle roasting and boiling.&nbsp; And, at noon, little Thekla
came rushing down from the watch-tower with news that all were
coming home up the Eagle&rsquo;s Steps, and she was sure
<i>her</i> baron had sent her, and waved to her.&nbsp; Soon
after, <i>her</i> baron in his glittering steel rode his
cream-coloured charger (once Friedel&rsquo;s) into the castle
court, followed by his exultant merrymen.&nbsp; They had
overtaken the thieves in good time, made them captives, and
recovered the spoil unhurt; and Heinz and Koppel made the castle
ring with the deed of their young lord, who had forced the huge
leader of the band to the earth, and kept him down by main
strength till they could come to bind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By main strength?&rdquo; slowly asked Sir Eberhard, who
had been stirred into excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a loose-limbed, awkward fellow,&rdquo; said
Ebbo, &ldquo;less strong than he looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only that, Sir,&rdquo; said Heinz, looking from his
old master to his young one; &ldquo;but old iron is not a whit
stronger than new steel, though the one looks full of might, and
you would think the other but a toy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you done with the rogues&rsquo;
heads?&rdquo; asked the old knight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I looked to see
them on your spears.&nbsp; Or have you hung them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, Sir,&rdquo; said Ebbo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sent the
men off to Stuttgard with an escort.&nbsp; I dislike doing
execution ourselves; it makes the men so lawless.&nbsp; Besides,
this farmer was Schlangenwalder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet he came to you for redress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for Sir Dankwart is at his commandery, and he and
I agreed to look after each other&rsquo;s lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Eberhard retired to his chair as if all had gone past his
understanding, and thence he looked on while his son and wife
hospitably regaled, and then dismissed, their auxiliaries in the
rescue.</p>
<p>Afterwards Christina told her son that she thought his father
was rested, and would be better able to attend to him, and Ebbo,
with a painful swelling in his heart, approached him
deferentially, with a request that he would say what was his
pleasure with regard to the Emperor, to whom acknowledgments must
in the first place be made for his release, and next would arise
the whole question of homage and investiture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you here, fair son,&rdquo; said Sir Eberhard,
rousing himself, &ldquo;these things are all past me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll have none of them.&nbsp; You and your Kaisar
understand one another, and your homage is paid.&nbsp; It boots
not changing all for an old fellow that is but come home to
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, father, it is in the order of things that you
should be lord here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was lord here, and, what is more, I would not,
and could not be.&nbsp; Son, I marked you yesterday.&nbsp; You
are master as never was my poor father, with all the bawling and
blows that used to rule the house, while these fellows mind you
at a word, in a voice as quiet as your mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Besides, what should I do with all these mills and bridges of
yours, and Diets, and Leagues, and councils enough to addle a
man&rsquo;s brain?&nbsp; No, no; I could once slay a bear, or
strike a fair stroke at a Schlangenwalder, but even they got the
better of me, and I am good for nothing now but to save my
soul.&nbsp; I had thought to do it as a hermit up there; but my
little Christina thinks the saints will be just as well pleased
if I tell my beads here, with her to help me, and I know that way
I shall not make so many mistakes.&nbsp; So, young Sir, if you
can give the old man a corner of the hearth while he lives, he
will never interfere with you.&nbsp; And, maybe, if the castle
were in jeopardy in your absence, with that new-fangled road up
to it, he could tell the fellows how to hold it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;dear father,&rdquo; cried the ardent Ebbo,
&ldquo;this is not a fit state of things.&nbsp; I will spare you
all trouble and care; only make me not undutiful; take your own
place.&nbsp; Mother, convince him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my son,&rdquo; said Sir Eberhard; &ldquo;your
mother sees what is best for me.&nbsp; I only want to be left to
her to rest a little while, and repent of my sinful life.&nbsp;
As Heinz says, the rusty old iron must lie by while the new steel
does the work.&nbsp; It is quiet that I need.&nbsp; It is joy
enough for me to see what she has made you, and all around.&nbsp;
Ah!&nbsp; Stine, my white dove, I knew thine was a wise head; but
when I left thee, gentle little frightened, fluttering thing, how
little could I have thought that all alone, unaided, thou wouldst
have kept that little head above water, and made thy son work out
all these changes&mdash;thy doing&mdash;and so I know they are
good and seemly.&nbsp; I see thou hast made him clerkly,
quick-witted, and yet a good knight.&nbsp; Ah! thou didst tell me
oft that our lonely pride was not high nor worthy fame.&nbsp;
Stine, how didst do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did it not, dear husband; God did it for me.&nbsp; He
gave the boys the loving, true tempers that worked out the
rest!&nbsp; He shielded them and me in our days of
peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; added Ebbo, &ldquo;Providence
guarded us; but, above all, our chief blessing has been the
mother who has made one of us a holy saint, and taught the other
to seek after him!&nbsp; Father, I am glad you see how great has
been the work of the Dove you brought to the Eagle&rsquo;s
Nest.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE STAR AND THE SPARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1531 has begun, and
Schloss Adlerstein remains in its strength on the mountain side,
but with a look of cultivation on its environs such as would have
amazed Kunigunde.&nbsp; Vines run up trellises against the rocks;
pot-herbs and flowers nestle in the nooks; outbuildings cluster
round it; and even the grim old keep has a range of buildings
connected with it, as if the household had entirely outgrown the
capacities of the square tower.</p>
<p>Yet the old hall is still the chief place of assembly, and now
that it has been wainscoted, with a screen of carved wood to shut
off the draughty passages, and a stove of bright tiles to
increase the warmth, it is far more cheerful.&nbsp; Moreover, a
window has been opened showing the rich green meadow below, with
the bridge over the Braunwasser, and the little church, with a
spire of pierced lace-work, and white cottages peeping out of the
retreating forest.</p>
<p>That is the window which the Lady Baroness loves.&nbsp; See
her there, the lovely old lady of seventy-five&mdash;yes,
lovelier than ever, for her sweet brown eyes have the same
pensive, clear beauty, enhanced by the snowy whiteness of her
hair, of which a soft braid shows over the pure pale brow beneath
the white band, and sweeping black veil, that she has worn by
right for twenty years.&nbsp; But the slight form is active and
brisk, and there are ready smiles and looks of interest for the
pretty fair-haired maidens, three in number, who run in and out
from their household avocations to appeal to the &ldquo;dear
grandmother,&rdquo; mischievously to tell of the direful yawns
proceeding from brothers Ebbo and Gottfried over their studies
with their tutor, or to gaze from the window and wonder if the
father, with the two brothers, Friedel Max and Kasimir, will
return from Ulm in time for the &ldquo;mid-day eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! there they are.&nbsp; Quick-eyed Vittoria has seen the
cavalcade first, and dances off to tell Ermentrude and Stine time
enough to prepare their last batch of fritters for the
new-comers; Ebbo and G&ouml;tz rush headlong down the hillside;
and the Lady Baroness lays down her distaff, and gazes with eyes
of satisfied content at the small party of horsemen climbing up
the footpath.&nbsp; Then, when they have wound out of sight round
a rock, she moves out towards the hall-door, with a light, quick
step, for never yet has she resigned her great enjoyment, that of
greeting her son on the steps of the porch&mdash;those steps
where she once met such fearful news, but where that memory has
been effaced by many a cheerful welcome.</p>
<p>There, then, she stands, amid the bright throng of
grandchildren, while the Baron and his sons spring from their
horses and come up to her.&nbsp; The Baron doffs his Spanish hat,
bends the knee, kisses her hand, and receives her kiss on his
brow, with the fervour of a life-devotion, before he turns to
accept the salutation of his daughters, and then takes her hand,
with pretty affectionate ceremony, to hand her back to her
seat.&nbsp; A few words pass between them.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
motherling,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I signed it not; I will tell
you all by and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the mid-day meal is served for the whole household,
as of old, with the salt-cellar in the middle, but with a far
larger company above it than when first we saw it.&nbsp; The
seven young folks preserve a decorous silence, save when Fraulein
Ermentrude&rsquo;s cookeries are good-naturedly complimented by
her father, or when Baron Friedmund Maximilianus breaks out with
some wonderful fact about new armour seen at Ulm.&nbsp; He is a
handsome, fair, flaxen-haired young man&mdash;like the old
Adlersteins, say the elder people&mdash;and full of honest gaiety
and good nature, the special pride of his sisters; and no sooner
is the meal over, than, with a formal entreaty for dismissal, all
the seven, and all the dogs, move off together, to that favourite
gathering-place round the stove, where all their merry tongues
are let loose together.</p>
<p>To them, the Herr Vater and the Frau Grossmutter seem nearly
of the same age, and of the same generation; and verily the
eighteen years between the mother and son have dwindled into a
very small difference even in appearance, and a lesser one in
feeling.&nbsp; She is a youthful, beautiful old lady; he a grave,
spare, worn, elderly man, in his full strength, but with many a
trace of care and thought, and far more of silver than of brown
in his thin hair and pointed beard, and with a melancholy
thoughtfulness in his clear brown eyes&mdash;all well
corresponding with the gravity of the dress in which he has been
meeting the burghers of Ulm; a black velvet suit&mdash;only
relieved by his small white lace ruff, and the ribbon and jewel
of the Golden Fleece, the only other approach to ornament that he
wears being that ring long ago twisted off the Emperor
Maximilian&rsquo;s chain.&nbsp; But now, as he has bowed off the
chaplain to his study, and excused himself from aiding his two
gentlemen-squires in consuming their krug of beer, and hands his
mother to her favourite nook in the sunny window, taking his seat
by her side, his features assume an expression of repose and
relaxation as if here indeed were his true home.&nbsp; He has
chosen his seat in full view of a picture that hangs on the
wainscoted wall, near his mother&mdash;a picture whose pure
ethereal tinting, of colour limpid as the rainbow, yet rich as
the most glowing flower-beds; and its soft lovely <i>pose</i>,
and rounded outlines, prove it to be no produce even of one of
the great German artists of the time, but to have been wrought,
under an Italian sky, by such a hand as left us the marvellous
smile of Mona Lisa.&nbsp; It represents two figures, one
unmistakably himself when in the prime of life, his brow and
cheeks unfurrowed, and his hair still thick, shining brown, but
with the same grave earnestness of the dark eye that came with
the early sense of responsibility, and with the first sorrow of
his youth.&nbsp; The other figure, one on which the painter
evidently loved to dwell, is of a lady, so young that she might
almost pass for his daughter, except for the peculiar, tender
sweetness that could only become the wife and mother.&nbsp; Fair
she is as snow, with scarce a deepening of the rose on cheek, or
even lip, fragile and transparent as a spiritual form, and with a
light in the blue eyes, and a grace in the soft fugitive smile,
that scarce seems to belong to earth; a beauty not exactly of
feature, but rather the pathetic loveliness of calm fading
away&mdash;as if she were already melting into the clear blue sky
with the horizon of golden light, that the wondrous power of art
has made to harmonize with, but not efface, her blue dress,
golden hair, white coif, and fair skin.&nbsp; It is as if she
belonged to that sky, and only tarried as unable to detach
herself from the clasp of the strong hand round and in which both
her hands are twined; and though the light in her face may be
from heaven, yet the whole countenance is fixed in one absorbed,
almost worshipping gaze of her husband, with a wistful simplicity
and innocence on devotion, like the absorption of a loving
animal, to whom its master&rsquo;s presence is bliss and
sunshine.&nbsp; It is a picture to make light in a dark place,
and that sweet face receives a loving glance, nay, an absolutely
reverent bend of the knightly head, as the Baron seats
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was as we feared, and this Schmalkaldic League
did not suit thy sense of loyalty, my son?&rdquo; she asks,
reading his features anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother.&nbsp; I ever feared that further pressure
would drive our friends beyond the line where begin schism and
rebellion; and it seems to me that the moment is come when I must
hold me still, or transgress mine own sense of duty.&nbsp; I must
endure the displeasure of many I love and respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, my son, they have known you too long and too
well not to respect your motives, and know that conscience is
first with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarce may such confidence be looked for, mother, from
the most part, who esteem every man a traitor to the cause if he
defend it not precisely in the fashion of their own party.&nbsp;
But I hear that the King of France has offered himself as an
ally, and that Dr. Luther, together with others of our best
divines, have thereby been startled into doubts of the lawfulness
of the League.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what think you of doing, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall endeavour to wait until such time as the
much-needed General Council may proclaim the ancient truth, and
enable us to avouch it without disunion.&nbsp; Into schism I
<i>will</i> not be drawn.&nbsp; I have held truth all my life in
the Church, nor will I part from her now.&nbsp; If intrigues
again should prevail, then, Heaven help us!&nbsp; Meantime,
mother, the best we can, as has ever been your
war-cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And much has been won for us.&nbsp; Here are the little
maidens, who, save Vittoria, would never have been scholars,
reading the Holy Word daily in their own tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach, I had not told you, mother!&nbsp; I have the Court
Secretary&rsquo;s answer this day about that command in the
Kaisar&rsquo;s guards that my dear old master had promised to his
godson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another put-off with Flemish courtesy, I see by thy
face, Ebbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that, mother.&nbsp; The command is ready for
the Baron Friedmund Maximilianus von Adlerstein Wildschloss, and
all the rest of it, on the understanding that he has been bred up
free from all taint of the new doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New?&nbsp; Nay, it is the oldest of all
doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so.&nbsp; As I ever said, Dr. Luther hath been
setting forth in greater clearness and fulness what our blessed
Friedel and I learnt at your knee, and my young ones have learnt
from babyhood of the true Catholic doctrine.&nbsp; Yet I may not
call my son&rsquo;s faith such as the Kaisar&rsquo;s Spanish
conscience-keepers would have it, and so the boy must e&rsquo;en
tarry at home till there be work for his stout arm to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems little disappointed.&nbsp; His laugh comes
ringing the loudest of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Junker is more of a boy at two-and-twenty than I
ever recollect myself!&nbsp; He lacks not sense nor wit, but a
fray or a feast, a chase or a dance, seem to suffice him at an
age when I had long been dwelling on matters of
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wast left to be thine own pilot; he is but one of
thy gay crew, and thus even these stirring times touch him not so
deeply as thou wert affected by thine own choice in life between
disorderly freedom and honourable restraint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that choice to-day, mother, as I crossed
the bridge and looked at the church; and more than ever thankful
did I feel that our blessed Friedel, having aided me over that
one decisive pass, was laid to rest, his tender spirit unvexed by
the shocks and divisions that have wrenched me hither and
thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay; not hither and thither.&nbsp; Ever hadst thou a
resolute purpose and aim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever failed in by my own error or that of
others&mdash;What, thou nestling here, my little Vittoria, away
from all yonder prattle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear father, if I may, I love far best to hear you and
the grandmother talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear the child!&nbsp; She alone hath your face, mother,
or Friedel&rsquo;s eyes!&nbsp; Is it that thou wouldst be like
thy noble Roman godmother, the Marchesa di Pescara, that makes
thee seek our grave company, little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always long to hear you talk of her, and of the
Italian days, dear father, and how you won this noble jewel of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, child, that was before those times!&nbsp; It was
the gift of good Kaisar Max at his godson&rsquo;s christening,
when he filled your sweet mother with pretty spite by persuading
her that it was a little golden bear-skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her how you had gained it, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By vapouring, child; and by the dull pride of my
neighbours.&nbsp; Heard&rsquo;st thou never of the siege of
Padua, when we had Bayard, the best knight in Europe, and 500
Frenchmen for our allies?&nbsp; Our artillery had made a breach,
and the Kaisar requested the French knights to lead the storm,
whereto they answered, Well and good, but our German nobles must
share the assault, and not leave them to fight with no better
backers than the hired lanzknechts.&nbsp; All in reason, quoth I,
and more shame for us not to have been foremost in our
Kaisar&rsquo;s own cause; but what said the rest of our misproud
chivalry?&nbsp; They would never condescend to climb a wall on
foot in company with lanzknechts!&nbsp; On horseback must their
worships fight, or not at all; and when to shame them I called
myself a mountaineer, more used to climb than to ride, and vowed
that I should esteem it an honour to follow such a knight as
Bayard, were it on all fours, then cast they my burgher blood in
my teeth.&nbsp; Never saw I the Kaisar so enraged; he swore that
all the common sense in the empire was in the burgher blood, and
that he would make me a knight of the noblest order in Europe to
show how he esteemed it.&nbsp; And next morning he was
gone!&nbsp; So ashamed was he of his own army that he rode off in
the night, and sent orders to break up the siege.&nbsp; I could
have torn my hair, for I had just lashed up a few of our nobles
to a better sense of honour, and we would yet have redeemed our
name!&nbsp; And after all, the Chapter of proud Flemings would
never have admitted me had not the heralds hunted up that the
Sorels were gentlemen of blood and coat armour long ago at
Li&egrave;ge.&nbsp; I am glad my father lived to see that proved,
mother.&nbsp; He could not honour thee more than he did, but he
would have been sorely grieved had I been rejected.&nbsp; He
often thought me a mechanical burgher, as it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so, my son.&nbsp; He never failed to be proud
of thy deeds, even when he did not understand them; but this, and
the grandson&rsquo;s birth, were the crowning joys of his
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those were glad triumphant years, take them all in
all, ere the Emperor sent me to act ambassador in Rome, and we
left you the two elder little girls and the boy to take care
of.&nbsp; My dear little Thekla!&nbsp; She had a foreboding that
she might never see those children more, yet would she have pined
her heart away more surely had I left her at home!&nbsp; I never
was absent a week but I found her wasted with watching for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was those weary seven years of Italy that changed
thee most, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apart from you, mother, and knowing you now indeed to
be widowed, and with on the one hand such contradictory commands
from the Emperor as made me sorely ashamed of myself, of my
nation, and of the man whom I loved and esteemed personally the
most on earth, yet bound there by his express command, while I
saw my tender wife&rsquo;s health wasting in the climate day by
day!&nbsp; Yet still, while most she gasped for a breath of
Swabian hills, she ever declared it would kill her outright to
send her from me.&nbsp; And thus it went on till I laid her in
the stately church of her own patroness.&nbsp; Then how it would
have fared with me and the helpless little ones I know not, but
for thy noble godmother, my Vittoria, the wise and ready helper
of all in trouble, the only friend thy mother had made at Rome,
and who had been able, from all her heights of learning and
accomplishment, to value my Thekla&rsquo;s golden soul in its
simplicity.&nbsp; Even then, when too late, came one of the
Kaisar&rsquo;s kindest letters, recalling me,&mdash;a letter
whose every word I would have paid for with a drop of my own
blood six weeks before! and which he had only failed to send
because his head was running on the plan of that gorgeous tomb
where he is not buried!&nbsp; Well, at least it brought us home
to you again once more, mother, and, where you are, comfort never
has been utterly absent from me.&nbsp; And then, coming from the
wilful gloom of Pope Leo&rsquo;s court into our Germany, streamed
over by the rays of Luther&rsquo;s light, it was as if a new
world of hope were dawning, as if truth would no longer be
muffled, and the young would grow up to a world far better and
purer than the old had ever seen.&nbsp; What trumpet-calls those
were, and how welcome was the voice of the true Catholic faith no
longer stifled!&nbsp; And my dear old Kaisar, with his clear
eyes, his unfettered mind&mdash;he felt the power and truth of
those theses.&nbsp; He bade the Elector of Saxony well to guard
the monk Luther as a treasure.&nbsp; Ah! had he been a younger
man, or had he been more firm and resolute, able to act as well
as think for himself, things might have gone otherwise with the
Church.&nbsp; He could think, but could not act; and now we have
a man who acts, but <i>will</i> not think.&nbsp; It may have been
a good day for our German reputation among foreign princes when
Charles V. put on the crown; but only two days in my life have
been as mournful to me as that when I stood by Kaisar Max&rsquo;s
death-bed at Wells, and knew that generous, loving, fitful spirit
was passing away from the earth!&nbsp; Never owned I friend I
loved so well as Kaisar Max!&nbsp; Nor has any Emperor done so
much for this our dear land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young Emperor never loved thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have treated me as one who could be useful,
but he never forgave me for shaking hands with Luther at the Diet
of Worms.&nbsp; I knew it was all over with my court favour after
I had joined in escorting the Doctor out of the city.&nbsp; And
the next thing was that Georg of Freundsberg and his friends
proclaimed me a bigoted Papist because I did my utmost to keep my
troop out of the devil&rsquo;s holiday at the sack of Rome!&nbsp;
It has ever been my lot to be in disgrace with one side or the
other!&nbsp; Here is my daughter&rsquo;s marriage hindered on the
one hand, my son&rsquo;s promotion checked on the other, because
I have a conscience of my own, and not of other
people&rsquo;s!&nbsp; Heaven knows the right is no easy matter to
find; but, when one thinks one sees it, there is nothing to be
done but to guide oneself by it, even if the rest of the world
will not view it in the same light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else!&nbsp; I doubt me whether it be ever easy
to see the veritably right course while still struggling in the
midst.&nbsp; That is for after ages, which behold things afar
off; but each man must needs follow his own principle in an
honest and good heart, and assuredly God will guide him to work
out some good end, or hinder some evil one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, mother.&nbsp; Each party may guard one side or
other of the truth in all honesty and faithfulness; he who cannot
with his whole heart cast in his lot with either,&mdash;he is apt
to serve no purpose, and to be scorned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Ebbo, may he not be a witness to the higher and
more perfect truth than either party have conceived?&nbsp; Nor is
inaction always needful.&nbsp; That which is right towards either
side still reveals itself at the due moment, whether it be to act
or to hold still.&nbsp; And verily, Ebbo, what thou didst say
even now has set me on a strange thought of mine own dream, that
which heralded the birth of thyself and thy brother.&nbsp; As
thou knowest, it seemed to me that I was watching two sparkles
from the extinguished Needfire wheel.&nbsp; One rose aloft and
shone as a star!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My guiding-star!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other fulfilled those words of the Wise Man.&nbsp;
It shone and ran to and fro in the grass.&nbsp; And surely, my
Ebbo, thy mother may feel that, in all these dark days of
perplexity and trial, the spark of light hath ever shone and
drawn its trail of brightness in the gloom, even though the way
was long, and seemed uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mother who ever fondled me <i>will</i> think so, it
may be!&nbsp; But, ah! she had better pray that the light be
clearer, and that I may not fall utterly short of the
star!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Travellers in Wurtemburg may perhaps turn aside from glorious
old Ulm, and the memories of the battlefields around it, to the
romantic country round the Swabian mountains, through which
descend the tributaries of the Danube.&nbsp; Here they may think
themselves fortunate if they come upon a green valley, with a
bright mountain torrent dashing through it, fresh from the lofty
mountain, with terraced sides that rise sheer above.&nbsp; An old
bridge, a mill, and a neat German village lie clustered in the
valley; a seignorial mansion peeps out of the forest glades; and
a lovely church, of rather late Gothic, but beautifully designed,
attracts the eye so soon as it can be persuaded to quit the
romantic outline of the ruined baronial castle high up on one of
the mountain ledges.&nbsp; Report declares that there are tombs
in the church well worth inspection.&nbsp; You seek out an old
venerable blue-coated peasant who has charge of the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is yonder castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the castle of Adlerstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the family still extant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, yea; they built yonder house when the Schloss
became ruinous.&nbsp; They have always been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church is very beautiful in its details, the carved work
of the east end and pulpit especially so, but nothing is so
attractive as the altar tomb in the chantry chapel.&nbsp; It is a
double one, holding not, as usual, the recumbent effigies of a
husband and wife, but of two knights in armour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are these, good friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the good Barons Ebbo and Friedel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father and son they appear to be, killed at the same time in
some fatal battle, for the white marble face of one is round with
youth, no hair on lip nor chin, and with a lovely peaceful
solemnity, almost cheerfulness, in the expression.&nbsp; The
other, a bearded man, has the glory of old age in his worn
features, beautiful and restful, but it is as if one had gone to
sleep in the light of dawn, the other in the last glow of
sunset.&nbsp; Their armour and their crests are alike, but the
young one bears the eagle shield alone, while the elder has the
same bearing repeated upon an escutcheon of pretence; the young
man&rsquo;s hands are clasped over a harp, those of the other
over a Bible, and the elder wears the insignia of the order of
the Golden Fleece.&nbsp; They are surely father and son, a maiden
knight and tried warrior who fell together?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the guide shakes his head; &ldquo;they are
twin brothers, the good Barons Ebbo and Friedel, who were born
when their father had been taken captive by the Saracens while on
a crusade.&nbsp; Baron Friedel was slain by the Turks at the
bridge foot, and his brother built the church in his
memory.&nbsp; He first planted vines upon the mountains, and
freed the peasants from the lord&rsquo;s dues on their
flax.&nbsp; And it is true that the two brothers may still be
seen hovering on the mountain-side in the mist at sunset,
sometimes one, sometimes both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You turn with a smile to the inscription, sure that those
windows, those porches, that armour, never were of crusading
date, and ready to refute the old peasant.&nbsp; You spell out
the upright Gothic letters around the cornice of the tomb, and
you read, in medi&aelig;val Latin,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Orate pro Anima Friedmundis Equitis Baronis
Adlersteini.&nbsp; A. D. mccccxciii&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then turn to the other side and read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Eberardus Eques Baro
Adlersteini.&nbsp; A.D. mdxliii.&nbsp; Demum&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the guide is right.&nbsp; They are brothers, with
well-nigh a lifetime between their deaths.&nbsp; Is that the
meaning of that strange <i>Demum</i>?</p>
<p>Few of the other tombs are worth attention, each lapsing
further into the bad taste of later ages; yet there is one still
deserving admiration, placed close to the head of that of the two
Barons.&nbsp; It is the effigy of a lady, aged and serene, with a
delicately-carved face beneath her stiff head-gear.&nbsp; Surely
this monument was erected somewhat later, for the inscription is
in German.&nbsp; Stiff, contracted, hard to read, but this is the
rendering of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies Christina Sorel, wife of
Eberhard, xxth Baron von Adlerstein, and mother of the Barons
Eberhard and Friedmund.&nbsp; She fell asleep two days before her
son, on the feast of St. John, mdxliii.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her children shall rise up and call her blessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erected with full hearts by her grandson, Baron
Friedmund Maximilianus, and his brothers and sisters.&nbsp;
Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
