description: 'Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823-1901), was an English novelist, known for
  her huge output. She was devoted to the Church of England, and much influenced by
  John Keble, a near neighbour and one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Her
  novels reflected the values and concerns of Anglo-Catholicism. She began writing
  in 1848, and published during her long life about 100 works, chiefly novels. Her
  first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1854), provided the funding to
  enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn.
  Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. She was also
  editor, for nearly forty years, of a magazine for young ladies, the Monthly Packet.
  Among the best known of her works are Heartsease; or, The Brother''s Wife (1854),
  The Daisy Chain; or, Aspirations (1856), A History of Christian Names (1863, revised
  1884), A Book of Golden Deeds (1864), The Dove in the Eagle''s Nest (1866), Life
  of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands (1873) and
  Hannah More (1888).'
